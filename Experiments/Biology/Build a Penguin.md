## Equipment Needed

- Felt fins
- Sunglasses
- Vegetable shortening
- Zip lock bags
- Felt vest
- Felt beak
- Soft penguin toy
- Ice cube tray
- Ice packs, or a bowl of icy water (optional – use ice packs from the cool boxes if on tour, or use the ice blocks to freeze ice in the school freezer)
- Plastic box containing a penguin toy (you will need to half-fill this with water)
- Model of penguin egg (about 12 cm long)

## Experiment Explanation


### How to demonstrate

Ask the kids what would happen if we were all dropped in the middle of Antarctica with no equipment. We probably wouldn’t last very long! Get them to think about the problems we might have, e.g. it’s very cold, we would struggle to find food, we might be hunted by the other animals (e.g. leopard seals, orcas). 

But there are many animals that happily live in Antarctica, such as penguins. Ask them what kind of adaptations penguins have to help them survive. As they suggest different adaptations, bring out the corresponding accessories and begin to dress a child up as a penguin. 

When the child is dressed, ask them what would happen if they tried to go about their day with all of these accessories. They would have a difficult time! Just like us, penguins are very well adapted to their environment, but would struggle if they were dropped into a different one. 

#### Physical Adaptations
Hand fins: Penguins eat fish, so need to be able to swim. They use their fins to swim, and their feet tuck in behind them to make them more aerodynamic. 

Blubber gloves: Penguins have a layer of blubber to keep warm. The blubber gloves consist of two ziplock bags with a layer of vegetable shortening in between. If you have access to ice packs or a bowl of icy water, get the children to hold an ice pack in the gloves or stick their gloved hands in the water. 

Felt vest: Penguins have black backs and white stomachs. This is called countershading in zoology, and the evolutionary purpose is under debate. It is probably to help with camouflage while swimming – when viewed from below, their white stomachs blend into the bright sky above, but when viewed from above, their black backs blend into the dark sea below. This helps them avoid predators and catch prey. You can show this with the box of water – when the penguin is floating on its stomach and you look at it from above against the black “deep sea” background, it camouflages. You can hold the box above your heads to see the penguin from below against the white “sky”. (Another reason for the colours could be thermal regulation – the black helps absorb heat when they are cold, but the white stomachs help dissipate heat – however this theory has less support). 

Beak: Beaks help to catch fish and carry rocks if needed for making nests. Beaks are often hooked or sharp to help hold things. 

Sunglasses: Penguins need to be able to see when it is bright on the ice, and when it is dark under water. Their pupils can dilate to change retinal illumination by 300-fold (compared to 16-fold in humans). The sunglasses are shaded to imitate penguins on land, where reflection from the ice makes things very bright, so their pupils are very contracted to limit the amount of light that enters. The mirror can be used to demonstrate pupil dilation if it is bright enough. Ask the children to close their eyes for 5-10 seconds, then open them and look in the mirror. They should be able to see their pupils rapidly contract. Penguins also have a nictitating membrane across their eyes. This is a third eyelid that can cover the eye to keep it lubricated, provide protection, and improve vision (a bit like sunglasses!). 

Eyebrows: Some species of penguin have a bit of yellow on their body, such as around their neck. Rockhopper penguins have bright yellow eyebrows, like the ones stuck on the sunglasses. This is just to make the penguins look good, in particular to help them attract mates. Large, bright eyebrows are a sign of good health, which makes the penguin a good choice of mate!

#### Behavioural Adaptations
Huddling: Penguins also keep warm by huddling together. At the centre of a huddle of Emperor Penguins, the temperature can be 37°C (even in an ambient temperature of -40°C). The penguins take turns in the centre and on the edges of the huddle. 

Nesting: Give the children the egg and ask them to think about how they would keep an egg warm and protected. This is a model of an Emperor penguin egg (the largest of all penguin eggs). Penguins can do this in a few ways. Some penguin species build nests by scratching into the ground and surrounding the indentation with rocks and pebbles. Other species dig burrows into the ground, or use natural borrows like caves. Emperor and King penguins keep their eggs warm by holding them on their feet, nestled into their bodies. 

Parenting: Penguins share parenting between a pair. Some penguin species form long-term relationships, but others, like the Emperor Penguin, find a new mate every season. At first, the parents take turns guarding the chick while the other goes out to hunt. The hunting penguin returns and regurgitates partially digested food into the chick’s mouth. When the chicks are old enough, they form tight groups (called creches). The amount of time that parents spend raising their chicks varies between species. The shortest is 56 days in Adelie Penguins, and the longest is fifteen months in King Penguins. 

Why don’t penguins’ feet freeze? Penguins don’t have blubber or feathers on their feet to keep them warm, so they need other mechanisms. These can be behavioural – Emperor Penguins rock back and forth on their feet to reduce the amount of time their feet are in contact with the ice, balancing on their tail. There are physical adaptations too. Penguins can change the diameter of their blood vessels to control the rate of blood flow. In the cold, they reduce blood flow to their extremities (including their feet) to avoid losing heat. Humans do this too – this is why our hands and feet go white when they are very cold!

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Vegetable shortening

**Description**: Someone could eat the shortening, causing illness if it has gone bad. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Do not open the ziplock bags while demonstrating. The shortening should be replaced every six months to stop it going bad, and the date of replacement written on the bags. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Vest

**Description**: Risk of small children tripping on the vest if it is too long

**Affected People**: Small children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Discourage the children from running while wearing the vest and encourage them to take care. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Small penguin toy

**Description**: Could cause choking in small children. 

**Affected People**: Small children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Keep the toy inside the closed box when the children are around. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

### **Hazard**: Spilt water

**Description**: Risk of slipping

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Clean up spills immediately. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Ice and cold water

**Description**: Cold shock 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Use a bowl with ice and water rather than just ice. Do not let the children put their hand in the bowl or touch the ice pack for more than a few seconds.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
