## Equipment Needed

- Sheep skeleton, containing bones numbered 1-11
- Board with sheep anatomy diagram
- 2x printout of sheep skeleton (one numbered for demonstrator use, one without)
- Printout of human skeleton
- Bonus sheep anatomy printouts (tailbone; feet; ribs)

## Experiment Explanation

### In a nutshell
The aim of this experiment is to show children a (half) complete animal skeleton, so they can see how some parts are very different (legs, feet) and some parts are quite similar (spine, ribs) to how a human skeleton looks. Even the "very different" parts have similar bones, because we evolved from a common ancestor that had similar bones. They can also handle the bones directly and notice just how well the joints slot together.

### Set-up
Lay the anatomy diagram board flat on a table or other hard surface. Spread out the sheep bones nearby. Place the unnumbered sheep skeleton on the table for children to reference. Keep the numbered skeleton for demonstrator use, as the numbers match numbers on the sheep bones and will let you confirm everything is in the right place.


### How to demonstrate
1. Start by asking the children if they know what the skeleton is. They'll probably guess because the anatomy diagram board has a wooly sheep outline, but you can also have them look at the sheep's teeth and notice it's a herbivore (see notes) and at the feet and notice it only has two toes. Give them progressively easier hints (eg "found on a farm, wooly, baas") and they'll guess it quickly. For older groups you may want to spend more time on identification and comparison, if so see the section below.

2. Have the children assemble the completed sheep skeleton. Note that we have HALF a sheep skeleton here to make it easier to lay out on the anatomy board: there is a complete skull and spine, but only half the ribs, 1x forelimb and 1x hindlimb(including just one scapula (shoulder blade) and half of the pelvis). As the children are assembling things, see how many bones they can name. Help them work out where leg bones go by noticing which bones slot together at the joint. Compare with the numbered diagram to correct them.  

3. Discuss the bones themselves and how they differ from human bones and how they're similar. Can do this as they assemble or after, depending on how quickly the children finish it. Talk about what the bones do -- ribs protect the internal organs, the skull protects the brain, etc. Also have the children bend the legs at the joints appropriately -- notice how the "wrist"/"ankle" joints are the lower joints we see and NOT the knees or elbows, because a sheep's foot is extended. See notes for more information.

### Notes

1. Skull
- Point them towards Animal Skulls to discuss the teeth/skull in more detail, but can discuss how the teeth tell us this is a herbivore. Big, flat molars/premolars are good for grinding and crushing up vegetation. Incisors are good for pulling grass and other vegetation. Note that sheep are lacking upper incisors; instead, they have a hardened gum line called a "dental plate" to pinch grass against. 

2. Spine
- The spine can be divided into the cervical vertebrae (neck), thoracic vertebrae (ribcage), lummbar vertebrae (lower back), sacrum (where the pelvis attaches) and **normally** we should also have coccygeal vertebrae that make up the tail, but our sheep is missing its tailbones. 

3. Ribs
- Sheep have 13 pairs of ribs: 8 pairs are sternal/true ribs that would connect directly with the sternum; 4 pairs are asternal/false ribs that don't connect directly with the sternum because they connect to the ribs above; and one pair of floating ribs that don't connect with the sternum at all. See "ribs printout" -- this is a human diagram, but the structure is similar.

4. Front foot
- Made up of the phalanges in the toes, the metapodial/cannon bone in the "palm" (equivalent to fused metacarpals), and carpals in the "wrist". See "front foot printout" for how the bones differ from a human hand. A sheep's foot is made of some of the same bones a human hand has, and would be equivalent to a human hand with just the middle and ring finger. Notice how sheep, like many animals, walk on just their toes. Sheep toes are normally covered by horn material to make hooves, similar to horses. Note that the first "bend" in the front leg is equivalent to the wrist.

5. Radius and Ulna
- Would be the lower arm in a human, and joins at the elbow with 6 (humerus). Have the kids move the bones in a hinge fashion like a human arm would.

6. Humerus
- Would be the upper arm in a human

7. Scapula / shoulderblade (note the absence of clavicle)
- Similar to the shoulderblade in a human, but note that unlike humans, sheep (and horses) lack a clavicle/collarbone connecting to the scapula. In humans, the clavicle acts as a strut between the shoulderblade and the sternum, connecting the arm directly to the spinal column; but in sheep the front limb attaches only via muscle and tendons. The missing collarbone improves running efficiency because without the collarbone the shoulderblade can act almost like an extra limb segment, creating a longer stride.

8. Hind foot
- Made up of the phalanges in the toes, the metatarsals, and the tarsals in the hock. See "hind foot printout" for how the bones differ from a human foot (the printout shows a horse foot but they are structurally similar, minus a sheep having two toes vs a horse's single toe).

9. Tibia
- Would be the lower leg in a human, and joins at the knee wth 10 (femur).

10. Femur
- Would be the upper leg in a human. Notice how high up in the body the knee joint is; this is why some people think an animal's "knees" are where we now know the ankles are, and why some people think their "knees bend backwards". Their knees bend the right way, they just have them hidden under wool!

11. Pelvis (half)
- Joins with the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints, and with the femur at the hip joint. Notice the hip is a ball and socket joint, unlike the hinge joints of the elbow/knee. Swivel the bones in the joints to show how much freedom of movement there is.

### Identification
If you want to do this in detail then you really need to turn the board over between demos. In schools asking the previous gorup to shuffle the bones back to a pile then flip it over quickly during changeover.

Start by taking wild guesses. Expect some terrible (hopefully joke) guesses to start with. If something is ridiculous then try and rule it out straight away, there are some really obvious facts you can use to help:
- Size: by laying out the spine you can find an approximate length of animal. If they can identify the skull you can figure its head size. If they can find some leg bones  you can figure out how tall it was. These are all rough measurements, and we dont know if this animal was fully grown or not however should rule put some guesses. For example, Duck, Girrafe, Pidgeon, Elephant.
- Wings/Beak: This sheep doesnt have any. If children are instant its a bird ask them to find the wing bones and compare to a chicken.
- Similarity to us: You can probably use this as a catch-all to eliminate most non-mamals. E.g., Shark, Fish, etc.


From this you are hopefully at the point where we're looking at mammals. You can now do some more detailed investigation eliminating other (closer) guesses:
- Toes: This sheep has two. Rules out Human and various primates. This animal has hooves so is an ungulate, in fact we can say it is an even-toed ungulate (vs. an odd toed one)
- Eyes: The sheep has side eyes, suggesting its a prey animal.
- Teeth: Herbivore. The sharp teeth at the front may cause some confusion, but ask them to think if those teeth would rip meat from a carcass.
- Collarbone: Some mammals have these (e.g., primates, felines) and others dont (e.g.,  canines, ungulates)

At this point we are down to an (even-toed) ungulate and contextually probably a ruminant, usong the size info the only real candidates left are sheep, goat, deer or a baby of some other type. At this point the details get more subtle hwoever things to look for are:
- Deer will have some horn base formation. The horn base is also more pointy in goats. This skeleton has a cueved short horn base, offering the (easiest to see) evidence it is a sheep, although without a goat for comparison its hard to confirm.

For a long while CHaOS was uncertain wether the skeleton was that of a sheep or a goat until we got some more experienced veterinary opinions. More nuanced features include:
- Humerous and scapula is slightly different between goats and sheep.
- The trachea is a different shape.
- See this paper: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178543
While it may seem weird there's not a lot of information on this if you think from the perspective of a vet sheeo and goats are easy to distinguish externally (wool). The main research comes from zooarcheologists who can only use bone information, and even they have contextual clues beyond the bones.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Sharp parts of the bones.

**Description**: Some bones may have sharp edges, especially around the skull.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Remind children to handle bones carefully. The skull has been inspected and sharp edges filed down, but some may have been missed, or breakages could produce sharp edges. Demonstrator should visually inspect skulls before use - any skulls with sharp edges may need to be smoothed off or replaced. 

Call first aider in event of incident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4


<br/>

### **Hazard**: Broken bones

**Description**: If dropped, bones may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other injuries.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator to keep a close eye on anybody holding the skull, as this is the most likely to shatter if dropped. If a skull smashes, clear it up immediately with dustpan and brush. Any damaged skulls with sharp edges should be repaired as soon as possible - demonstrator should notify committee if this is needed. Most of the bones are quite light, but demonstrator should watch all children handling bones, especially the more club-like ones like the femur. The number of bones out has been limited by e.g. wiring feet together and threading the spine together to make it easier for the demonstrator to monitor.

Call first aider in event of injuries.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>


### **Hazard**: Unsanitary bones

**Description**: Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: All bones have been sterilised by soaking in bleach for several hours. Please note, however, this does not necessarily mean that the skulls are completely sterile now. One could give the skulls a gentle clean with disinfecting wipes if they're on hand.

Call first aider to properly dress and sterilise wounds. Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut themselves on the skull. Advise parents to take child to a doctor if the cut looks infected.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
