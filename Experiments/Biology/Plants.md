**Biology**

**Active** (Experiment has working equipment at the time of last update, and is available for events.)

**CBS only** (Non-transportable experiments that tend to be used for CBS only.)

## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- *Needs significant preparation in the days running up to the event*

- Beansprouts in plastic containers, germinated prior to event, under different conditions (e.g. light/dark/water/no water/warm/cold)
- Magnifying boxes
- Microscope and slides showing section through plant leaves, stem, stomata, germinating seed

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Ideas to explain:
----------

For younger children

- Talk about what plants need to grow (water, warmth, light)
- Look at sequence of development i.e. seed, beansprout, small plant, larger plant, bigger plants flower and produce seeds (life cycle)
- Plants need light to produce energy - they don't eat like animals do (avoid using the term 'photosynthesis' with small children)
- Might want to look at plant cells in the microscope. They have a cell wall, so have a rigid shape, unlike animal cells. Green because of the pigment (chlorophyll) that they use to produce energy from light.

----------

Older children

- More detail on the different events happening in early plant development

- More detail on photosynthesis i.e. carbon dioxide converted into sugars, and oxygen is produced (the opposite idea to respiration)
- Gas exchange (Carbon dioxide for oxygen) happens through pores on the underside of leaves called stomata (you should be able to see these on one of the slides - see below).
- Light is absorbed by the green pigment (chlorophyll) in the leaves
- Plants have to transport sugars made in the leaves to other parts of the plant - this happens in the phloem (visible on slides)
- Water is transported from the roots in xylem (visible on slides - see below)

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Microscope

**Description**: Electrical hazard (microscope), especially near sources of water.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: See separate electrical parts risk assessment, keep microscope away from water as it is not required for this experiment.
In case of injury, call first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Thin glass slides

**Description**: Using thin glass slide could result in broken glass with risk of cuts.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: If slides are broken, carefully collect/sweep up broken pieces, wrap in paper and dispose of carefully.
In case of injury, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Microscope light fitting

**Description**: The light fitting under the microscope becomes hot, and could cause burns.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Warn children to be careful, turn off lamp when not in use. If it's getting hot, put a cardboard shield around (but not touching) the lamp to prevent accidental contact.
In case of accident, call a first aider and encourage children to run burns under tepid water for 10 minutes.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Specimens

**Description**: Possible allergic reaction to seeds/plants/soil/leaf specimens. Possible illness from injesting samples. 

**Affected People**: Demonstrator/Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ask parents if child is allergic to the plant we are using before beginning the demonstration. In case of adverse reaction, call a first aider. Tell children who have been touching soil to wash hands after experiment and supervise at all times so that children do not eat the sample. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Seedling jars

**Description**: Injury from dropping seedling jars/plants.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Have seedlings in plastic container, and use plastic plant pots. In case of injury, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 1, Overall: 1

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Electrical cables

**Description**: Trip hazard from microscope cable/extension cord.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Avoid setting up so wires are in a walkway, tape down cables. In case of injury, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
