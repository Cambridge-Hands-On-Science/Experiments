## Experiment Explanation 

### Overview

Children will look at lots of jars and blocks of interesting creatures, try to identify them, and learn a few things are each one. This is one of those experiments where you'll often get kids who are very interested or not really interested at all, so feel free to vary how long you keep them with you depending on how interested they seem. Don't worry if they only look at one thing then leave!

**Tips for demonstrating:**

1) Make sure that none of your bugs disappear during the day! I would recommend having a smaller selection out at a time so you can keep an eye on them all (and can remember interesting facts about them all). Some selection ideas are included but feel free to come up with your own sets!
2) If they're young ask them to look at their fingernail or a hair under the magnifying glass – this will give them a better concept of scale and show them how much more detail you can see under the magnifying glass!

**Basic info**

We have a large selection of perspex blocks containing a range of arthropods. Arthropods include: insects; arachnids (spiders, scorpions and mites); crustaceans (including crabs and woodlice); and myriapods (including centipedes and millipedes). The phylum arthropoda also includes trilobites, which are now extinct. Arthropods have existed in some form since before the dinosaurs, with the first arriving ~500 million years ago (dinosaurs appeared ~240 million years ago, and humans about 200,000 years ago). 

### Basic procedure and explanation

Ask the child to choose a sample on display that looks interesting to them. Then go through the following questions with them:

1) What do you think this is?
2) Do they know anything about the type of bug? (if they recognise it they will often start splurging everything they know about it - just let them talk to you about it!)
3) If they look using the magnifying glass can they see anything interesting (hairs on legs, joints of exoskeleton etc. - talk about the purposes of these things if you know!) 
4) For older/very keen kids you can talk about taxonomy (a good website to flick through if you have time before you start: http://www.earthlife.net/insects/classtax.html)

### About the Insects

These insects were released as part of a children's magazine series "Real Life Bugs and Insects" which was done in partnership between the Natural History Museum and National Geographic (RRP £5.99 an issue). CHaOS has all 100 issues plus a bonus insect for subscribing to all issues, these were bought second-hand in 2023. All the insects included were (at the time of release in 2016) "not endangered or threatened species". They were also (allegedly) "bred, farmed and harvested in a sustainable way" coming from "specialised, purpose-built farms and the (publishers) can certify that none of these specimens were taken from the natural environment". (Quotes taken directly from the magazine publishers)

There was some controversy at the time of release about how true these statements were. For instance, the stag beetle (sample ID) has a seven-year larvae stage which seems impractical for a magazine gift. You can discuss this if you really want to.

Many children will ask how they are made. The insects inside are all real. They were gassed before being encased in resin. 


### Key descriptions for perspex blocks

**Beetles General Info**

*The Creator, if He exists, has an inordinate fondness for beetles.* - JBS Haldane, geneticist, worked in Cambridge for a time

Beetles are the largest group of insects, with over 400,000 known species (about 4000 in the UK). Insects generally have two pairs of wings, but in beetles the forewings are hardened into elytra that protect the hindwings. Although beetles are still capable of flight, this adaptation allows them to burrow and move around on the ground without damaging their wings, which is what scientists believe to be the reason they are so numerous. With so many species, beetles exhibit amazing diversity – we have a sample of different species here for you to compare.

**Large Specimens Box (Box L) and Spider**

0) Cuban Tarantula <br>
This isn't in the box but loose and large. Cuban Tarantulas are farmed as an allegedly tasty snack. They don't have a poisonus bite but do have itchy hairs. You can see these clearly on the legs without a microscope. Insert more facts.

1) Giant Scorpion <br>
Scorpions are arachnids (not insects!). Many people know they use their stinger to inject venom into their prey and for self-defence, but if they have a choice they prefer to use their pincers, because producing venom is costly. While their venom can be deadly, it’s also used in biomedical research, with anti-inflammatory properties that make an effective treatment for arthritis. Scorpions also have hairs on their tail which can sense the movement of nearby prey.

2) Spur-throated Grasshopper <br>
Grasshoppers make their song using stridulation (scraping) - have a comb-like structure and a ridge on each wing and rub the comb of one wing against the ridge of the other (demonstrate using comb) (compare with cicada). They have a thick membrane on their wing which resonates to amplify the sound. Their big legs make them great jumpers, able to jump 25cm vertically, and leap up to a metre horizontally.

3) Rhinoceros Beetle <br>
Named because of their large horn, which males use to fight over females. Rhino beetles can lift up to 850 times their own weight. They’re slow to grow and can spend from a few months up to two years in the grub stage (depending on the species), and can be some of the biggest beetles in the world – the heaviest beetles are a type of rhino beetle called Megasoma, and the longest beetle in the world is the Hercules beetle.

4) Praying Mantis <br>
Praying mantises are very effective hunters, typically noshing on other insects and the occasional amphibian, but have even been observed capturing small birds. They’re ambush predators that blend in with their environment and wait for prey to come close (discuss camouflage appearance with children). They are the only invertebrates to see in 3D, giving them better depth perception.

5) Golden Silk Orb Weaver <br>
Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They produce silk using special glands called spinnerets at the end of their abdomen. While all spiders produce silk, not all of them create webs, but orb weavers like this one produce beautiful webs.

6) Chinese Stick Insect <br>
Stick insects are masters of camouflage! 

7) Whip Scorpion <br>
Whip scorpions are not true scorpions, but do have a similar appearance. They are arachnids, and while they are not venomous, they can spray an acidic mix that has a vinegar-like smell – earning them the alternative name vinegaroons. There are about 150 species worldwide, mostly in the tropics.

8) Armoured Cricket <br>
Armoured crickets are not true crickets (biologists are weird sometimes). They’re omnivorous and eat almost anything, from plants to other insects. However, being fat and flightless, they’re also on the menu for a lot of other animals. Their first line of defence is their armoured exoskeleton, from which they derive their name, and they have strong jaws to bite with. Males use stridulation to deter predators (see: Large Specimens #2). If all that fails, they can squirt their blood at predators – it is pale green, acrid-smelling, and distasteful.

9) Madagascan Hissing Cockroach <br>
One of the largest species of cockroach in the world – adults can grow up to 10cm long! They are important for the health of the rain forest, because they are detrivores, which means they eat decaying plant matter and animal carcasses, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. They hiss by expelling air from their spiracles – these are holes in the side of all insect bodies through which they breathe.

10) Spotted Black Cicada <br>
Cicadas are some of the longest-lived insects – nymphs can live for up to 17 years underground before emerging as adults, at which point they scream for three months, mate, and then die. They use tymbals (modified exoskeleton walls on abdomen sides) to produce their loud noise - works by buckling (demonstrate using jam jar lid) (compare with grasshopper, Large Specimens #2)

**Box A**

1) Manchurian Scorpion <br>
See Large Specimens #1.

2) Emerald Beetle

3) Giant Froghopper <br>
Froghoppers are capable of jumping many times their height and length. As nymphs, they suck on plants and encase themselves in foam in springtime, which looks like spit on leaves, earning them the nickname spittlebug.

4) Tropical Black Cicada <br>
See Large Specimens #10 for cicada info. 

5) Giant Wasp <br>
Native to Asia, but have been sighted in North America, where they are invasive and a threat to bees. Their stingers can be up to 6mm long and deliver potent venom, enough to kill a mouse!

6) Blue Weevil <br>
Weevils are a type of herbivorous beetle with long snouts (called a rostrum). The weevil family is the largest beetle family, with 45,000+ named species (which also makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom). Some weevil species can be pests. This blue weevil is blue to warn predators that he’s not tasty – they eat yam leaves which are toxic to most animals, so eating enough blue weevils can be toxic as the chemicals from the yam leaves build up in them. Being brightly coloured to deter predators is a classic defence mechanism called aposomatism.

7) Giant Forest Ant <br>
Ants are eusocial (meaning they live in large colonies), usually with a queen and many workers. They build elaborate nests and tunnel systems, and some species of ants even farm fungi. Within a colony, different ants have different jobs: soldier ants are bigger than the others and will defend the nest, whereas worker ants are small and will forage for food or tidy the nest, and the queen lays all the eggs.

8) American Cockroach <br>
Cockroaches can survive without their heads for over a week - they breathe through spiracles (holes in their exoskeleton) so don't suffocate without heads, but die of dehydration. They also don't bleed to death as they have open circulatory systems (unlike our high pressure systems).

9) Long-horned Beetle
  
10) Sugarcane White Grub Beetle
    
11) Wasp Spider <br>
See A6 for aposomatism. Wasp spiders are brightly colored and striped to mimic the appearance of a wasp, but they are not actually dangerous! They’re tricking predators into thinking they are by mimicking insects that are dangerous.

12) Giant Shield Bug
    
13) Brown Grasshopper <br>
See Large Specimens #2.

14) Exotic Planthopper <br>
Walks very slowly, pretending to be a leaf; then, if it needs to escape predators/catch prey, it can do big leaps like a grasshopper.

15) Asiatic Cricket <br>
Crickets are closely related to grasshoppers, and also stridulate. (See Large Specimens #2).

**Box B**

1) Flower Mantis <br>
See Large Specimens #4. Note the camouflage comparison between the two mantis species – one pretends to be a stick, the other a flower. Different species of flower mantis have different patterns (specific to the area they live in and what flowers are there). They sit very still, waiting for pollinators to come up to them, then strike out with their long forearms.

2) Asian Forest Scorpion <br>
See Large Specimens #1.

3) Asian Centipede <br>
Centipedes and millipedes are myriapods (not insects!). Centipedes have around 15-30 legs, whereas millipedes typically have 40-400 legs. If they lose any of their legs, they can regenerate them. Centipedes are much faster than millipedes, despite how many more legs millipedes have! Millipedes are also quite shy, and will curl into a spiral if startled. Centipedes are carnivores, and can bite if threatened.

4) Tropical Mole Cricket <br>
Mole crickets are burrowing insects, with small eyes and shovel-like forelimbs that are highly developed for digging. They spend most of their lives underground, but adults have wings and disperse in the breeding season.

5) Oriental Flower Beetle

6) Chinese Blister Beetle

7) Paper Wasp <br>
Paper wasps make their nests by chewing up fibres from dead wood and plant stems, producing large structures that look papery. They generally only attack if their nest is threatened, and are otherwise not aggressive. Like blue weevils (A6) they are brightly coloured to warn predators away, as their stings deliver potent venom.

8) Thai Stag Beetle <br>
Stag beetles are similar to rhinoceros beetles (see Large Specimens #3), and also spend a long time as grubs and grow to be quite large. Males have huge mandibles that they use to fight other males and throw each other around. Being bitten by some stag beetles would feel like balancing two coke cans on toothpicks on one of your fingers.

9) White Dragontail <br>
A lovely butterfly. Butterflies have taste receptors in their feet to help them find the best food. Adult butterflies can only feed on liquids, usually nectar in flowers, using a long tubular structure called a proboscis (like a drinking straw); but caterpillars usually eat leaves.

10) Litchi Stink Bug
    
11) Malaysian Jewel Beetle

12) Pollen Basket Bee <br>
Bees are eusocial animals (live in colonies) with a queen and many workers. They are important pollinators, and honey bees are kept to produce honey for people to eat.
 
13) Beautiful Cicada <br>
See Large Specimens #10 for cicada info.

14) Asian Stag Beetle <br>
See B-8.

15) Shield-backed Bug <br>
Named for their shape -- closely related to stink bugs.

**Box E**

1) Asian Water Beetle <br>
Some species of water beetle carry an air bubble under their abdomen to prevent water getting into its spiracles. Other species have a modified exoskeleton which can carry out gas exchange with the water. This particular water beetle is a tasty food in south-east Asia, often boiled or fried whole. The taste is often compared to sweet scallops or shrimp.

2) Damselfly <br>
Damselflies are closely related to dragonflies, though tend to be smaller, more delicate, and fly weakly in comparison with them. At rest, damselflies hold their wings together and parallel to their bodies, whereas dragonflies keep their wings horizontal and spread apart.

3) Devil Spider

4) Fruit Chafer Beetle

5) African Jewel Beetle

6) Long-nose Jungle Beetle <br>
Their long nose is for eating pollen out of flowers. Used to think they were pests as they prefer to eat dead flowers and so were always found when there were lots of dying plants - correlation not causation!

7) June Beetle

8) Unicorn Beetle <br>
See Large Specimens #3.

9) Click Beetle

10) Golden Asian Stag Beetle

11) Formosa Stag Beetle <br>
See B8 for stag beetles.

12) Orange spotted Cockroach <br>
A tropical species of cockroach – see A8 for more.

13) Horned Flower Chafer (beetle)
    
14)Spotted Longhorn Beetle

15) Chinese Lantern Bug <br>
Lantern bugs are native to China, but are an invasive species in South Korea and the United States. They produce honeydew which they leave behind on plants. Other bugs like to eat the honeydew, but it can also cause sooty mould to grow on plants, inhibiting the plant’s ability to photosynthesize and hurting the plant’s ability to survive and grow.

### Interesting Pairings

In this section we'll pick out a few pairs/groups of specimins from across the boxes which have interesting comparitive elements you can talk about. You will probably want 12-20(ish) samples and this section hopefully helps with some ideas although you are welcome and encouraged to come up with new connections or just talk about them individually.

- Types: Have an assortment of insects (many), arachnids (many), crustaceans (none yet) and myriapods [B3,F?]. You can get people to try and sort them, usually the number of legs is a good hueristic. Including Stick Insect [A6] is good if you want people to guess the types, most people will get arachnids but may struggle on insects, in which case point them to this one.
- Invasive Species: Giant Wasp [A5] and some other wasp (e.g., Paper Wasp [B7])  
- Avoiding being eaten: Talk about Stick Insect [A6] which is camoflauged. Compare Wasp Spider [A11] and a wasp (e.g., Paper Wasp [B7]) as disguise. Aposmatism is fairly opposite and is bright colours as a warning (e.g., Blue Weevil [A6] or Paper Wasp [B7]).
- Farming: Cuban Tarantula [L0] is farmed for food (probably several others too). A scorpian (e.g., Giant Scorpian [L1]) may be farmed medically for venom. Spider silk may also be farmed (e.g., Orb Weaver [L5]).
- General similarities: Lots of pairs of closely related insects have very similar features and kids can identify these and figure out they're related. Lots work for this, e.g., Cockroaches [L9,A8,E12].

Some sample sets:
- Tom's Selection (17 bugs) - L0, L1, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L9, A1, A5, A6, A8, A11, B3, B7, B8, The Millipede from F?

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Breaking the blocks/jar/magnifying glass

**Description**: Smashing a specimen block/jar or magnifying glass could cause cuts.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8 (unacceptable)

**Mitigation**: It is very unlikely that the perspex blocks would break, even with a significant amount of force. However, demonstrators should keep a careful eye on the blocks and jars and magnifying glass, account for all specimen tubes every time a demonstration is completed.
Call first aider in case of injury (cut). Clear up perspex (using the dustpan and brush from Set Up and Clear Up), wrapping up in paper or similar so that it won't rip through the bin bag. Place in broken glass box if available at a school.
In case of injury, call first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Tripping over blocks

**Description**: Blocks are quite small and their transparency means that it might be difficult to see them, creating a potential tripping hazard.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (medium)

**Mitigation**: Demonstrators should make sure that blocks are not played with by young children without supervision. 
If a block is dropped, it should be picked back up as soon as the area is safe to do so. 
In case of a child (or adult) tripping over, call first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Perspex blocks

**Description**: Kids may throw them or drop them on feet

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (medium)

**Mitigation**: Take away from kids if they are being silly with them. Keep all perspex blocks in sight during the demonstration.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Magnifying Glass

**Description**: Kids (or demonstrators!) may set fire to paper or dry grass if very sunny day.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 6 (medium)

**Mitigation**: Prevent kids from removing magnifying glasses. Take away from kids (and scold demonstrators) if they are deliberately trying to set fire to things. If possible, avoid setting up this experiment somewhere with bright light or near the window.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Preservative

**Description**: Could escape if jars are broken/opened. Preservative is 1% Propylene phenoxetol, which should not be irritant to eyes or skin at that concentration, but which may be harmful if ingested. (If asked about the toxicity of propylene phenoxetol, mention that it is used as a preservative in personal care products and it is chemically inert).

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8 (unacceptable)

**Mitigation**: Keep a careful eye on the jars and do not let anyone open them. They should all be taped up around the top - if the tape is coming off redo it. If any liquid leaks, clear it up straight away, preferably wearing gloves, then wash your hands immediately. Advise any children to wash their hands immediately if any liquid goes on their skin.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (medium)
