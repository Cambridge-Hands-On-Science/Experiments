## Experiment Explanation 

**Plant Diseases** 
The first aim is to introduce children to the idea of plants getting diseases, what might cause them, what effects it could have on us, and how we can treat them, etc. Here are some ideas of leading questions you could ask:
- Can plants get diseases/sick? - Yes!
- What might cause a plant to get sick? Bacteria, fungi, virus, environmental factors, pests
- What might a sick plant look like? - Losing leaves, unusual colour, unusual growth, mold, (see photos)
- Have you seen a diseased plant? What symptoms did it have? - mouldy fruit, cankers on trees
- How might we treat plant diseases? (How do we treat human diseases?) - antibiotics, fungicides, quarantine, and (hopefully not in humans) selective breeding, genetic modification
- What impact might plant diseases have? (food security/environment/forests/other animals) - famine, food production, trees dying off cause loss of forests/habitats/carbon sink
- Why are plant diseases important? - we want to stop the above
- Can you name any plant diseases? potato blight, ash dieback, Botrytis cinerea (fruit mold), rose black spot, citrus canker
- What might affect how we treat plants? - money! cost of treatment has to go into the food prices. Also the law, some treatments are banned as they have side effects on the environment (e.g. killing bees, polluting rivers)

**Crop Loss Game**
This is an optional demo to highlight crop loss in some common household crops. 
You might want to do this first if you do it.
For each crop, the idea is the full Tupperware represents the total potential harvest and they need to pour into the other how much they think is lost to plant diseases.
One student can pour for each crop and everyone else can guess if they think it should be higher or lower. You can use the scales and these numbers to calculate the correct amounts.
The aim is to emphasize how much crop loss affects people - from the world's poorest farmers to consumers who rely on these crops as a key part of their diet. What effects do they think this loss has on supermarket prices (or shrinkflation).

Rice - up to 30% loss to diseases and another 10% to pests. Rice blast is a particularly severe disease caused by a fungus. Rice is the staple food for more than half the world's population and is particularly important to the worldest poorest farmers.
The poorer someone is the more of their calories come from rice. Increases in rice costs have caused riots.

Coffee - up to 60% loss. Coffee Rust is a fungus causing orange patches on the leaves resulting in a lack of photosynthesis. Currently endemic in all coffee-producing countries.
Severe rust makes it uneconomical to grow coffee. Fungicide can be used but is too expensive for smaller farmers.
Rust didn't use to affect high-altitude plantations, but possibly due to global warming, rust has spread higher.
"Arabica" coffee is more desirable to consumers (and thus gets more money) but is more susceptible to rust. "Robusta" is more rust-resistant but gets much lower prices.

(Note we don't currently have any cocoa beans but they'd be a natural expansion)
Cocoa Beans - up to 100%
Frosty pod can wipe out entire plantations. It's a fungus that eats the insides and outsides of cocoa pods.
Currently confined to Southern and Central America but has not yet reached Africa. If it does the world cocoa production would be devastated.

**Identifying Diseases**
This is an optional section featuring some printouts of different plant diseases and healthy plants for comparison. You may wish to link these into the questions at the start (for instance if students are struggling to think of symptoms).
(Currently work in progress but these would be good pictures to have then add some more details)
Coffee / Coffee Rust
Cocoa Beans / Frosty Pod
Rice / Rice Blast
Potatoes / Late Blight (Tubers + Leaves)
Tomatoes / Late Blight
Potatoes / Nemotodes (Tubers + Roots)
Ash / Ash Dieback
Cirtus / Citrus Canker
Roses / Rose Black Spot
Apple / Brown Rot
Tobacco / Tobacco Mosiac Virus
Apple / Crown Gall Disease
Barley / Powdery Mildew
(maybe some pest photos for differences too)
