## Experiment explanation
The first aim is to introduce children to the factors affecting plant growth. Ask them what is required for a plant to grow. Common answers are sunshine, water and soil. Ask them what plants need from each. Sunshine is needed for photosynthesis, which the plant needs to make sugar as food. Water is needed for a lot of things, most importantly for keeping plant cells turgid (explain that plant cells are basically like water balloons), which means the plant can stay upright and keep growing. Soil is not only where the plant stays anchored to, but also the place where the plant gets other nutrients apart from sugar - just like us plants cannot only eat sugar all day!

Plants can also be affected by many issues. Pests can eat all parts of a plant. Bring out some photos of common pests (e.g. aphids, leaf miners) and ask them if they have seen these in the wild, for example they might have noticed that cars parked under lime trees get sticky in summer - this is because aphids love lime trees and suck sugary sap out of the trees all day! Ask them what the effect of these pests could be on the plant - some pests may only have a minor effect, but some can damage the parts of the plant needed to grow e.g. if the leaves are eaten the plant would no longer be able to grow. Some can also carry diseases. Examples include rose black spot, caused by a fungus, citrus canker, caused by a bacteria, and rhizomania (literally meaning crazy roots), caused by a virus. Ask them if they have seen these examples in real life e.g. in the garden, or in rotten fruit. 


**The Potato Game**
We're now going to play a game to show how hard it is to balance protecting crops with making money. You're all going to be farmers and make the same decisions with the goal of making as much money as possible.

How it works.

Each farmer has one field in which they can plant potatoes in.
They each start with £4000 in cold hard cash (monopoly money).
The game will last three months, in each of which some potatoes will die.
Each child will start with 20 small potatoes. Explain the potatoes are worth £1000 each when sold (they are very special potatoes).

Players can opt for genetically modified disease-resistant potatoes. There are a series of "resistant" flags which will denote who has planted resistant potatoes. It costs £2000 for resistant and £1000 for standard. Explain that both varieties are the same except the resistant potatoes have a chance to not get sick. 
Players can then opt to spray pesticides or not spray, spraying will reduce their potato loss if disease hits. It costs £1000 to spray.
Players can also opt for fertilisers, giving them an extra potato each round and immunity to poor soil conditions. This costs £1500. 

The catch - some people prefer organic potatoes, and will pay more for them if you let them grow without using any of the above! Each potato at the end of the game is worth £100 less for each of the above used - discuss at the end of the game why people think so and what the overall impact of each strategy is.

Next, spin the wheel to determine the scenario. 

**Scenario 1: Drought**

A terrible drought has come to the farm! Plant cells are like little balloons filled with water, which pushes the plant upright - without water a plant will wilt and die! Roll the die to determine how many potatoes die in each farm. 

**Scenario 2: Pests**

Humans like to eat potatoes, and so do all sorts of pests. Wireworms love to chew on potato tubers, while potato beetles love chewing on leaves. If you have used insecticides, congratulations! You do not lose any potatoes. Otherwise roll the die to determine how many potatoes die in each farm. 

**Scenario 3: Poor soil**

Plants need nutrients to grow. Unfortunately, there just isn't much in the soil. If you have used fertiliser, congratulations! Nothing happens and you still get your extra potato. Otherwise roll the die to determine how many potatoes are lost. 

**Scenario 4: Disease**

Plants get sick too! Unlike humans who have an immune system that can learn to fight off a disease after having it once (which is why vaccines work for us!), plants are basically "born" with a set of tools for fighting off disease. 

    Things to say about plant-pathogen interactions: 
    - Plants have both passive and active defenses against pathogens. Passive responses are in place all the time to prevent infection. Examples of this are the tough cell wall (physical), waxy cuticle on leaf (physical) and antimicrobial phenolic compounds (chemical). Active responses are triggered by pathogen infection. Examples of this include hypersensitive response (sacrificing infected leaves to protect the whole plant), making cell walls stronger, producing toxic chemicals and sending signals to the rest of the plant to prepare for infection.
    - Pathogens have counter-attacks to these defences and so there ends up being an arms-race over time (coevolution) where the pathogen and the plant develop responses to one-up the other and so disease-resistance won't last forever.

    Some facts about potato blight: 
    - Potato late blight is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It’s an oomycete, which are often described as ‘water moulds’ and are closely related to algae.
    - It infects potatoes (surprise) but also tomatoes.
    - Early symptoms are, dark spots appear on leaves and stems. Then, white mould appears under the leaves (Image 2) and the whole plant can quickly collapse.
    - Infected tubers (the bit we eat) develop dark patches that are brown beneath the skin and then rapidly decay into mush.
    - The disease caused the Irish Potato Famine (1845-57). Potatoes were the Irish staple crop and the loss caused over 1 million deaths and another 1 million people left Ireland due to the food shortages.

If you chose disease resistant potatoes, congratulations! No potatoes lost. Otherwise, players draw one of three "resistance" cards and one of three "pathogen" cards. If the receptor on the resistance card matches the pathogen card, your crop can recognise the disease and fight it off! Otherwise, roll the dice to decide how many potatoes are lost. 



At the end of the game (3 months) you should pay out for the potatoes left and see who's got the most money. Each potato with no controls used is worth £1000, deduct £100 from the price of each potato for each control measure used. 

Discuss why people think organic food is better e.g. belief that food is healthier, better for the environment etc. 
Ask them if they think these thoughts are valid - some people think using special genetically modified crops to prevent disease would make the potatoes unhealthy, but no proof for this claim exists. 

Pesticides and fertilisers - more complicated. Pesticides can be dangerous to human health, and there are many strict laws to prevent the use of more dangerous types. The types that are allowed break down into safer compounds, and there are strict laws on the maximum allowed to stay on food. Similar strict rules exist for fertilisers. If not properly used, both could cause damage to the environment - pesticides could enter the food chain, and fertiliser could cause eutrophication - discuss if these risks are worth the benefits - non-organic crops typically have higher yields, which also mean more people can be fed with less land being used, which may paradoxically mean that more of the environment is protected. Discuss which areas of the world are most affected by agricultural expansion and their views on how agriculture should progress. 


**How to Play**
In a school you probably want to group into two teams (more than 3 players is fairly chaotic). Be careful of the potatoes as children will steal them.

If you try and play it properly you probably want some mechanism to restict acess to resistant potatoes (only so many bags of each) and fertilizer (only bags for half). Otherwise everyone kind of ends up with the same number as they all do the same thing.

**Game Explanation** 
The game works on the assumption that you can grow 50 tonnes of potatoes per hectare and the crop value is £200/tonne. Each fake potato is 0.5 tonnes. For advanced groups you could talk about changing these paramaters. What would happen if there was a collapse in potato prices over the growing season, what factors do you think would cause this?
What other factors aren't included in the game? The weather will also affect growth and thus the price you get for the potatoes - so high-risk weather might lead to bigger crops.
There's also supply and demand which will factor in.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Eating fake Potatos

**Description**: Eating foam can cause choking. The tokens are pretty small.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Supervise particularly small children closely with potatoes. Don't do the full game with very young children (it's too complicated anyways). 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Dirty tokens 

**Description**: Children play with the tokens and may spread germs, other children may want to eat the potatoes and spread germs. 

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Supervise children closely. Stop children from licking or chewing foam potatoes. Don't do the full game with very young children. Encourage children to wash hands after using the experiment. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
