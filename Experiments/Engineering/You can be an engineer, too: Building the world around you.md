# You can be an engineer, too: Building the world around you

**nan** - What is engineering? And how can you become one? Come find out, and hopefully build something with CHaOSes very own 3D printer!

## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- 3D printer
- Laptop with Repetier Software
- USB cable
- Wireless widgets (?)
- Projector
- Powerpoint slides and videos

## Experiment Explanation 

The aim of this talk is to give kids a very rough idea of what engineering is.
Hopefully will dispel the common views that engineers are mechanics/electricians/boiler repairers.
Will talk about how engineers have shaped the world, and how they continue to do so.
Will use a 3D printer to talk about how we come up with novel ways of making things - will select a couple of kids at the start and print the first letter of their name in 3D perhaps?
Might also jury rig some wireless widgets that buzz flash based on radio signals to talk about how engineers can connect people all around the world.
Will make use of various short video clips (steam trains - rockets - computing)
Details will be fleshed out more leading up to event!

## Risk Assessment

('Hazard', 'Risk', 'Likelihood', 'Severity', 'Overall', 'Mitigation', 'Likelihood', 'Severity', 'Overall')

<br/>

('Power cables', 'Trip hazard.', 5, 2, 10, 'Ensure wires are either taped securely to surfaces, or are placed behind tables, so no one walking past will catch themselves on the wires. In case of an accident, turn off power at the mains, do not touch any other components, such as the laptop or its battery. Call first aider.', 1, 2, 2)

<br/>

('Electrical components', 'See electrical hazard RA.', 2, 3, 6, 'All laptop chargers will be PAT checked for safety and will be kept out of reach of children. See electrical parts RA.', 1, 2, 2)
