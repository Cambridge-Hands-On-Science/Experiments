## Experiment Explanation 

This experiment is fairly theoretical, on whiteboard maths, your challenge when demonstrating is to make it hands on! Make sure you play out some of the games.

When talking of game theory we really all need to be on the same page about what a game is. What do games have in common?
All games have **players**, how many might change but we really need at least one player to make it a game. 
**Winners and losers**, in a sense we should always have this. Even cooperative games we have everyone winning together. Winning is quite complicated and we're going to model it using **points**. We'll stick to a convention that positive points is good and negative bad. You could view these as money but we'll think about them just as generally good or bad things. E.g. imagine you're playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" over who has to do the washing up - a good example of when the loser might get "negative points". 
**Actions**, it wouldn't be a great game if there weren't any choices to make for one player.

There are other things some games have but others don't, E. G. Dice, chance, skillz, etc. "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a good example of a game with none of these.

Prisoners dilemma 
Both players are prisoners and have been taken to different rooms to talk to investigators, they have two choices. Stay silent or snitch on their accomplice. They've been promised a deal for snitching reducing their jail time by a whole year, however the extra evidence won't look good on the other person. If they both stay silent they'll each get a year. If one snitches and one doesn't, the snitch won't go to prison but the other gets three years. If both snitch they'll each do two years.
You can see both staying silent seems best for the group, however for the individual it is always better off to snitch: regardless of what the other player does, they will spend a year less in jail for snitching - the deal they're offered is true! We call snitch snitch the Nash equilibrium.
There's on problem with this model, people may have said 'snitches get stitches', in this model you'd get 0 years of prison and stitches, which are a big negative number to offset the equilibria.
This is a coordination game: it's best when people say the same thing. 
The other option of both silent is the optimum, however it's not stable to the other playing changing to snitch! This means this is not a Nash equilibrium. 
There is only one Nash equilibrium, we call this a pure strategy equilibrium too as players never mix between moves. 
You could reskin as the nuclear war arm or disarm game too. 

Chicken
(if anyone can give a better setting of this game please do)
Both players are driving at each other, they can keep straight or swerve. They get 0 points if both swerve (both chicken), if one swerves one straight then the server gets - 1 for being uncool and the straight 1 for coolness, if they both go straight they crash and die, this is minus a million each, as it's bad. This is anti coordination, players want to say the opposite. There are two Nash equilibria at both opposite points. In fact there's a range of 'non-pure' strategies where you pick at random between swerve and straight. One way to do better is by Symmetry breaking, we could play this game as a choose the side of the road to drive on. We break Symmetry by agreeing a Time.

There's more games if you want. 

## Further Explination from Lake
This works better the older the students. Year 9 worked really well
The main idea is to give situations where they have to decide things and then as you go introduce the question.. what is rational?  and you try to build up the main idea of decision theory and how to be rational. The strategy that you’ll end up giving to be rational is:
      You list your actions
      For each action you list outcomes
      For each outcome you associate a probability and a utility (which also includes knowing what your preferences are)

The questions here are pretty good, but I think there is a lot more work that can be done to make the introduction of these main ideas cleaner and also to make the transition better.
A cool thing about this experiment is that you can always wrap it up and conclude if you see they are starting to not care.
Another cool thing is bouncing off of the ideas of the students and trying to go where they questions are (probably you can design the experiment to make it more student guided)
The pacing of the situations is quite important, if they get bored they won't get unbored

Would you rather you each get 10p and I get 1 million pound or none of us get nothing?
What do you think is the rational decision?

Usually fairness gets brought up, but isn't considered rational, and then you can mention that actually they are both good, rational is only the means to the goals and those goals can include fairness.

Tragedy of the commons
All of you are in your own village (maybe ask them what the name of the village is if it seems they'll like that) and your food source is a pond of fish.
Sustainable 1 fish per day. What do you do? What do you think would happen?
What do you think is the rational decision?
Explain that actually the rational decision to take all the fish, because of the uncertainty. This may be a good place to talk about probability

There's a big red button, if you press it there's 50% chance of utopia and 50% chance all humans die. Do you press it?
This leads to the natural joke "there's a button so I press it"
This also shows the idea of how to value things, and you can go on to show that it's quite important what you think would happen if you didn't press the button. If you expect 90% utopia you clearly don't press the button. You also have something interesting.. If you only care about your subjective experience, and there isn't an afterlife, then there is a pretty strong argument that you should definitely press the button. Or if you care about maximise happiness and minimise suffering

A cool example of preference being arbitrary is "sharing is caring". You can explain that it's simply just based on our ancestors. Humans have nothing cool, no claws no muscles (look at a chimp eg). "all we have is each other. " So people that were selfish were kicked out of communities and so died off and the idea got integrated. If instead you were a spider you would totally be selfish

The stanford encyclopedia article on this is pretty good, as well as lesswrong

I think there are a lot of situations that you can make that are interesting, probably there also a bunch that are already known that I am not aware of, I didn’t research very much at all.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Whiteboard Pens

**Description**: Children could be tempted to lick the pens and become sick as a result.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Monitor the pens and don't let very small children use them (at least without supervision).
In case of licking, call first aider, or tell parent to contact GP if child feels ill later.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Whiteboard Pens

**Description**: People falling/slipping on pens that are dropped/roll off the table.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Only give out as many pens as you need and not until you need them, and keep the rest in the box. Carefully retrieve anything that is dropped immediately.
Call a first aider in case of accident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
