## Equipment Needed 
- Polydron kits (we have 2 sets of platonic solids and a 'small' set of Archimedean solid pieces)
- Selection of Solids
- Some laminated cards that came with one of the sets

<br/>

## Experiment Overview 
Polydron kits are a great way to build up 3D shapes. They should easily and intuitively clip together. The goal of this experiment is to build 3D shapes and talk about them mathematically.

The basic key concepts for all ages should be that of faces, vertices and edges. Hopefully, they'll be able to name many of the 2D faces and some of the 3D shapes at the end too.

There are a lot of different types of 3D shapes you can make, but in this experiment, we want to focus on some mathematically nice ones. Some key ``nice'' properties are:
**Convex** - This basically means if you connect any two points on the surface with a line it stays within the shape. We don't want shapes that bend back on themselves weirdly, no matter how much people might build them.
**Platonic** - A special type of 3D shape where all their faces are exactly the same, the faces are all regular (same angles and sides) and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five: the Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron and Isocohedron. 
**Archimedean** - A special type of 3D shape that's less restrictive than platonic. Faces don't have to be exactly the same but each vertex needs to look the same. 

## Experiment Stories
These are two ideas of a story to use when demonstrating this, one targeted at younger and one at older groups. You will likely want to adapt this, there are a bunch of topic suggestions below which can inspire a theme.

### Younger Story (by Lake)
With younger groups, you will likely find it harder to motivate the definitions of ``Platonic'' and ``Archimedean'' since they are quite abstract. However many younger children will be happy building away and there's an opportunity to sneak in facts relating to what they're doing.

You may find that young children get attached to the shapes they make. One way to deal with this is to have a special area to ``save shapes''. You may want to actually save any shapes that are interesting to talk about however unfortunately we don't have enough pieces to keep Barry's giant rocket that uses nearly every pentagon. It's worth emphasising we need to keep the pieces and it'll get broken down eventually, they need to leave the shape at some point and it's time for other people to have a go. It's also an experiment children can easily get absorbed in doing none maths things, don't be afraid to tell them to see something else or that someone else wants a go.

**Pre-built Platonic Solids** - If you have an example of each of the 5 built ask them to compare it to what they've built. What's different about them? What might the shapes be useful for? (dice) Would their shapes make good dice? 

**Octahedron Challenge** - Ask them to build an octahedron, often they'll make a triangular bipyramid (two triangular pyramids joined together). You can use these two shapes to get an idea of symmetry. The bipyramid clearly has a right way up, however turning the octahedron every way looks the same. There are clearly a lot more symmetries. Or platonic solids all have a lot of symmetries.

**Truncation** - This is a good way to combine two types of shapes but still make something symmetric. You can also link to the football. A football is likely to take a while to build so you may want to avoid this in schools.

**Filling 3D Space** - The cube is the only regular solid that tesselates 3D space.

**Prisms and Antiprisms** - These are cool to mention and build. You can then link to the fact that you can chop an icosahedron into a pentagonal anti-prism and two pentagonal pyramids, leading to its other name a ``gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid''.  

### Older Children Script (by Tom)
For older children, I like to focus on the ``about maths'' aspect. To do this I usually start by showing a cube. I ask what they think is special about a cube, and what properties we might see as nice or interesting. You can then start guiding them to the definition of Archimedean. Adding in a tetrahedron usually gets the key properties so you can write down the definition. I usually mention here these shapes make good dice and other properties that make them useful.

For mathematicians, once we've got a definition there are a few natural questions. First off is usually ``How many shapes satisfy this property?''. So take some guesses. They've seen at least 2 shapes so can guess anywhere between 2 and infinity. Once guesses are in, ask how they might find out if they are correct. You can do some building to show there are at least 5.

For uninterested groups, I tend to end here by claiming there are no more.

I then tend to do a guided proof there can't be a sixth. How many shapes are needed to make a corner? (at least 3) What happens with 3 hexagons? What happens with 4 pentagons? 

Where short on time or interest is now dropping I'll end here, everything past is just bonus content for the still engaged.

Following the how maths works theme I usually then talk about relaxing the definition. If you're interested in the symmetries of the shapes you can find some very symmetric shapes with different faces, so let's drop that condition but instead make sure each corner looks the same. 

It's worth asking again how many shapes like this there are. Produce a few new examples to show there are definitely new ones. It turns out the answer is infinite. We can show this nicely by producing an infinite family, the prisms. If students look harder they may also find the anti-prisms. Mathematicians like to keep asking how many, and the next question here is how many are there which aren't prisms or antiprisms? 

From here you can talk about truncation and how that affects symmetries. Chirality and what actually counts as different shapes or ask the question in higher dimensions or other generalisations. 

## Other Topics
These are an assortment of topics. This experiment is quite open-ended and you will likely want to vary what you do for different ages. The topics below are mentioned in some of the above-suggested scripts.

### Proof only 5 Archimedean Solids (12+)
For simplicity of notion in the explanation I'm going to use Schlafli symbols {$p$,$q$} where $p$ is the number of edges each face (e.g., for triangular faces $p=3$) has and $q$ is how many faces meet at a vertex (e.g., for a cube $q=3$). These leave {3,3} {4,3}, {3,4}, {5,3} and {3,5} as our platonic solids. You are unlikely to want to talk about these with children but mathematically they're convenient.

Try building things up, at a vertex the things that meet must have angles less than 360 degrees or else they won't fill space. You can easily try making each {$p$,$q$} into a 3D shape. Doing this we eliminate several options: having $q<3$ makes no sense as at least 3 shapes must meet to form a vertex; then anything with $p>5$ can't have 3 (or more fit together) at a corner as the angles are too big; finally, {6,3} encodes a tessellation of the plane by hexagons, so isn't 3D. Similarly {4,4} and {3,6} are tessellations, leaving us with only five options. It turns out all of these work, you can show this by making them or getting out the dice.

The above proof (using Schlafi symbols) is completely formal and completes the proof. In fact, this was an interview question for Queens' maths applicants. 

PLUS - You can also do a topological proof using Schlafli symbols. Using Euler's formula and the following fact: $pF=2E=qV$, you can bound things by eliminating $F$ and $V$ in Euler and then getting $\frac{1}{q} +\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{E} > \frac{1}{2}$. Then as $p,q >2$ we can find the only five possibilities. Again this just shows there are at most five, by giving the shapes we show there are at least five. We need to check this as we could have introduced new false solutions when doing this manipulation or reasoning.

### Euler's Formula (10+)
We can talk about Euler's Formula. The concept of face, edge and vertex (corner) should be easy to explain. Then get them to count up the number of each (hide the curvy-edged shapes). Now consider the magic formula, $V-E+F$, if you keep on trying it you should always get two!


### Prisms, Antiprisms, Truncation and Archimedean Solids (Any)
Archimedean Solids are the next step from platonic, removing the requirement that all the faces are the same. There are two infinite classes the prisms and Antiprisms (which have a belt of triangles and are slightly skew). These are sort of Archimedean but we exclude them as there's a prism and an anti-prism for each $n$-gon, thus infinitely many in each class. Then let's look at other ones. There's between 11-17 (roughly should double check) depending on your definition of 'the same', i.e. allowed isometries. 

The easiest to find are the truncated platonic solids, you get these by slicing corners off the solids, this doubles the number of sides and creates new faces. This gives 5 Archimedean Solids. 

You can also form some manageable ones with vertex patterns (3,4,5,4), (3,5,3,5), (8,6,4), (3,4,3,4), (4,4,4,3). There's also a very large one with the pattern (10,6,4) notable for how large it is. Patterns describe the number of sides in each shape clockwise around a vertex.

### Chirality (PLUS)
here are a few weird 'Archimedean Solids' which depend on your exact definition. There are two alignments of the shape (4,4,4,3) which has a belt of squares around the middle, this is formed with either the triangles aligned or not, the number of belts changes. There are also two snub shapes (3,3,3,3,4), (3,3,3,5), these expand the cube and dodecahedron with a belt of triangles. These two have a chirality which you can change by folding the net up and down.

### Dual Solids (PLUS)
Dual solids take faces ⇔ vertices. We do this by placing a vertex in the centre of each face and an edge between these vertices if the faces touch. Tetrahedrons are self-dual. Cubes and Octahedrons are a dual pair. Isocehedrons and Dodecahedrons are a dual pair. One can view this operation as swapping $p$ ⇔ $q$ in the Schlafli symbol.

### Hexaflexagons (PLUS)
You can link this to hexaflexagons by talking about symmetry groups. It may be easier to start with symmetry groups of faces and then move to the 3D shapes. You can talk about order and associativity. See the Hexaflexagons experiment for more info.

### Tesselations and Curvature (PLUS)
Talking about tessellations, there's a fairly interesting link as the platonic solids biject with tilings of the sphere (positive curvature) by projecting. The boundary cases {3,6}, {4,4} and {6,3} are plane tessellations and then any other {$p$,$q$} defines tessellations of hyperbolic surfaces (negative curvature).  

### Nets
Once you've built a shape, detach a few edges and flatten it out to form a net. A net is a 2D representation of a 3D shape. 
There are a few interesting questions you can ask. How many different nets does a cube have? I think there are eleven, up to symmetries, but I may be wrong. Try the same for an open cube (one face missing).

### 4D Platonic Solids
This is a bit higher level but can be cool/mind-blowing. We don't currently have print-outs but you can show the animations on a CHaOS laptop or tablet to visualise them.

### Footballs
This is a good topic for football-mad kids. Ask what shape a football is. A ``classic'' football shape is actually a truncated icosahedron, made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons and with a bit of bulge from air pressure is quite close to being a sphere. This 32-panel ball was introduced in the 1960s, before that balls were even less round and due to materials were quite heavy. If you've seen more recent World Cup balls often they have complex panels, this is from advances in manufacturing allowing more complex designs. The perfect football would always be a perfect sphere, however, they deform when being kicked and reducing this is part of the modern design improvements. There are also 24-pannel balls (using curved shapes) and 42-pannel balls (these replace the hexagons with 30 trapeziums). There are currently no photos of footballs printed but these could be added. 

### History
The platonic solids have been historically important, with Greek philosophers believing they corresponded to the five elements (we now know of more than 5 elements). The tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron correspond to fire, earth, air, ether and water. Of these none are elements, especially ether which doesn't exist. Kepler also believed the platonic solids formed shells on which the planets orbited, while close (coincidentally), it's not true either.
