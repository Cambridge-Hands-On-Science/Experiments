## Equipment Needed 
- A whiteboard and two colours of pen
- Print out of some of the boards and domino tilings (these need making and laminating)
<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 
You play on the whiteboard, you draw an 8x8 board, and I recommend having all the pens available. It’s very useful if you have a different colour for the students as at some point you’ll want it to be obvious who did what.

Intro: "We'll play a game, me vs you (the students as a collective, mention at some point that they can pass the pen around so everyone goes)

Here are the rules of the game: First player chooses a square, then you take turns making moves like this (you show king moves, but don’t say kings move, it’ll turn some people off immediately). The rule is that you can’t go to a square that has already been visited. The aim of the game is to trap your opponent, so when it’s their turn they can’t move (you might want to show an example in the corner)

Ask if they want to start. (I think that the best delivery has them explicitly decide to go first rather than second and then at the end they come to regret it, but then you get into the risk of them catching onto your tricks, and it’s actually pretty difficult to throw)

At some point mention that you can move diagonally, most people tend to forget about that.
Try to encourage them to try to find a strategy
It's usually pretty funny once or twice to suggest them moves while they're thinking on their move, and they react by being suspicious and doing the opposite move.
Try to vary up how much time you spend on your moves, but no need to act too hard
At the end of the game, you can ask them where they think it went wrong. Then you can replay from that moment
Then you can say that none of that mattered, cause the win was guaranteed
Let them stay in the feeling of the world turning upside down
They’ll tend to ask how?? There tends to be at least one kid who figures out that it’s because they went first
Ask them to take a look at what your moves were eg

Then give an explanation. 
The strategy is to in your mind fill the board with dominoes. They will enter a domino and you can just fill in the domino, you can always fill in the domino

I found it difficult to get this through to them so you'll have to figure out a way to do that. Something that made explanation easier is ti shade out the domino that is filled

Then look at 3x3 square and see if they get it. Since we have an odd number of squares you can’t fill the board with dominoes, there will be a hole. The strategy is to go first and fill in that hole.

Then you can ask “What about 127x127 board, should you go first or second?” it depends on whether we have an even or odd number

Here is a good place to stop

Extension
Go on a board that is 4x4 but with opposite corners removed

They will say that you should go second
Ask them what is their strategy, place the dominoes to fill the board
They might have a hard time, the trick is to use a diagonal domino

But we couldn’t go diagonally and so we couldn’t place that domino
Ask them whether they think it’s possible to fill the board with non-diagonal dominoes
Say/confirm that it’s actually impossible, but that we want to be sure of it and prove that we haven’t missed something
Draw the checkered pattern of white and black squares
Say that that's a hint

Let them count how many black vs. white squares there are
Also, ask them to look at the colours of the square that aren’t covered by a domino (they’re black,or white depending on what colouration you have)

Then ask about how they relate to dominoes
Explain that 1 domino covers one black and one white, so each time you place a domino you have minus 1 black minus 1 white. So you'll always end up with 2 black squares at the end

By this point, most people will want to go next.

But if they want to continue even more you then ask “What is the strategy now?”

Then you explain that the win condition is to always have a move, so whatever your opponent does you want to have a response.
Also, note that if you start on black squares you’ll always do a move that will go on a black square
So you’d actually want to start on a black square since there are more black squares and so you’ll have more option
In fact, you can actually map out how you will respond to what your opponent does
