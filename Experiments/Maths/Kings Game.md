## Equipment Needed 
- A whiteboard and two colours of pen
- Print out of some of the boards and domino tilings (these need making and laminating)
<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 
Draw an 8x8 grid on the whiteboard. I recommend having at least two pens available; it’s very useful if you have a different colour for the students as at some point you’ll want it to be obvious who did what.

Intro: "We'll play a game, me vs you" (the students as a collective, mention at some point that they can pass the pen around so everyone goes).

Here are the rules of the game. The first player chooses a square, then you take turns making moves like this (you show king moves, but don’t say king's move, it’ll turn some people off immediately). The rule is that you can’t go to a square that has already been visited. The aim of the game is to trap your opponent, so when it’s their turn they can’t move (you might want to show an example in the corner).

Ask if they want to start. (I think that the best delivery has them explicitly decide to go first rather than second and then at the end they come to regret it, but then you get into the risk of them catching onto your tricks, and it’s actually pretty difficult to throw.)

At some point mention that you can move diagonally; most people tend to forget about that. Try to encourage them to try to find a strategy. 

It's usually pretty funny once or twice to suggest them moves while they're thinking on their move, and they react by being suspicious and doing the opposite move. Try to vary how much time you spend on your moves, but no need to act too hard. At the end of the game, you can ask them where they think it went wrong. Then you can replay from that moment. Then you can say that none of that mattered because the win was guaranteed.

Let them stay in the feeling of the world turning upside down. They’ll tend to ask "how?" There tends to be at least one kid who figures out that it’s because they went first.
Ask them to take a look at what your moves were, e.g. ![image](https://github.com/Cambridge-Hands-On-Science/Experiments/assets/13450866/7de4ce5a-0237-42ed-bf0a-c8b69a3351c4). Then give an explanation. 

The strategy is to in your mind fill the board with dominoes. They will enter a domino and you can just fill in the domino, you can always fill in the domino:

This may be difficult to get through to them at first. Something that may make the explanation easier is to shade out the domino that is filled.

Then give a small example with a 3x3 grid and see if they get it. Since we have an odd number of squares, you can’t fill the board with dominoes, so there will be a hole. The strategy is to go first and fill in that hole.

Then you can ask “What about a 127x127 board, should you go first or second?” The answer is first - it depends on whether we have an even or odd number of squares.

## Extension
Play on a board that is 4x4 but with opposite corners removed:

They will say that you should go second.
Ask them what their strategy is, and how they should place the dominoes to fill the board.
They might have a hard time. The trick is to use a diagonal domino:
![image](https://github.com/Cambridge-Hands-On-Science/Experiments/assets/13450866/6d6025af-e33f-4509-8087-1c1db5c9acc1).
Ask them whether they think it’s possible to fill the board with non-diagonal dominoes.
Say/confirm that it’s actually impossible, but that we want to be sure of it and prove that we haven’t missed something.
Draw a checkered pattern of white and black squares like so:
![image](https://github.com/Cambridge-Hands-On-Science/Experiments/assets/13450866/26084b40-df60-4bcc-9abc-2eb78ea962eb).
Say that it's a hint and let them count how many black vs. white squares there are.
Also, ask them to look at the colours of the square that aren’t covered by a domino (they're either black or white depending on what colouration you have). Then ask about how they relate to dominoes.
Explain that 1 domino covers one black and one white, so each time you place a domino you have minus 1 black minus 1 white. So you'll always end up with 2 black (or 2 white) squares at the end.

By this point, most people will want to go next.
But if they want to continue even more you then ask “What is the strategy now?”
Then you explain that the win condition is to always have a move, so whatever your opponent does you want to have a response.
Also, note that if you start on black squares you’ll always do a move that will go on a black square.
So you’d actually want to start on a black square since there are more black squares and so you’ll have more options.
In fact, you can actually map out how you will respond to what your opponent does:

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Pens

**Description**: Children swallowing pen lids.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Keep a close eye on the pens when in use. If child swallows, call first aider and encourage child to cough if choking.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5
