## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->


### **Hazard**: Soapy water

**Description**: Skin irritation for people with cuts/eczema/allergies.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator and Demonstratees

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (medium)

**Mitigation**: Don't demonstrate if irritated by soapy water. Use a sign to indicate presence of soap. 
Ask parent/responsible child/leader if OK to put their hand in soapy water. Otherwise, demo only. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Soapy water

**Description**: Eye irritation

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12 (high)

**Mitigation**: Don't let anyone who touched the soapy water with their fingers touch their eyes without drying their hands first, including yourself. 
Know where the nearest eye wash is (usually Safety Box). Summon first-aider to wash eyes if necessary. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Soapy water

**Description**: Ingestion

**Affected People**: Demonstratees

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (medium)

**Mitigation**: Do not let children drink soap water or lick frames. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Wire ends

**Description**: Scratches and stabs in skin and eyes

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 5, Overall: 20 (unacceptable)

**Mitigation**: Demonstrators to be very careful of where open ends are, and to grip metal frames away from these. If children handle frames, 
make sure all ends are sealed away with tape / blu-tac / some other means to unsharpen them. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5 (medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Wire frames

**Description**: Trips and falls

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (high)

**Mitigation**: Make sure wires are on the table at all times when not in use. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Open containers of water

**Description**: Trips / slips / electrical shorts from spillages

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (high)

**Mitigation**: I would advise doing this experiment outside or in a room with a wipeable floor. Do not put near electrical equipment. 
Warn people of any spillages and clear them up promptly using the kitchen roll, in case of trips and hurting themselves. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (medium)
