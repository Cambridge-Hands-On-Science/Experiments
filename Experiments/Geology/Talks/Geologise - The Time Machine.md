## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- Various rock samples: fulgurite, coal, sandstone, mudstone, myriapod tracks
- Toy box with various toys (including toy dinosaur)
- Plastic tank and trays to put the various substances in
- Coloured sand and coloured play-doh and coloured liquid
- Blunt knife to cut the play-doh (with knife cover)
- Paper with different colours on each side
- Camera

## Experiment Explanation 

The audience enter the time-ship Geologise! and prepare to travel back in time with the presenters, one of whom has already been back in time (or that's what he says at least...) Unfortunately, the ship doesn't manage to time travel so they have to use the study of rocks to understand what happened millions of years ago.

Relative Dating:
Use layers of play-doh and different coloured sand in a tank to show the principles of stratigraphy - that layers of sediment form one on top of the other. Show how different processes can happen to the sequence of rocks to perturb the original stratigraphy, and the techniques used to unpick the chronology. Possibly inject a coloured liquid to a layer underneath to show how igneous rocks can cut across others. Show faulting (cut the play-doh using a blunt knife) and folding in the sequence to show how rocks can be offset at the surface. Get a toy dinosaur from the toy box (throwing the other soft toys carefully out behind them) and get a member of the audience to make footprints in the play-doh layer of the stratigraphy, and show how they can be preserved. Talk about unconformities and the concept of 'missing time' in relation to Hutton's Unconformity. The sand can also show varying sedimentation rates.

Absolute Dating:
All well and good being able to tell which rock was laid down first, but what time exactly did the rock form. Explain radiogenic isotope dating and the concept of half-life. Give the audience (shown on the screen with a camera, or a small group of children at the front) a piece of paper with a different colour on each side and get them to hold it up. Get half of the room after a certain amount of time to turn the cards over, and then half of the remaining group, and so on. The number of one colour relative to the other shows how old something is.

Different Environments:
The various layers of play-doh and sand can represent different rock formations found in a sample area (such as Arran, show the geological map) and each one captures a different environment. The Devonion Old Red Sandstone with large pebbles in a sandy matrix formed from an arid environment with river systems (show samples). The Carboniferous mud and coal deposits formed in a tropical environment with many trees and large insects like the myriapod (show the myriapod footprints and what can be deduced about the myriopod from this, think about fossil preservation in general). The Permian New Red Sandstone formed in a desert environment with occasional storms (show the fulgurite formed by lightning, get a child to feel the inside of it to show it has fused, shows the sandstone formed above ground).

The talk concludes with the point that you don't need to travel in time to work out what happened millions of years ago, and in fact it is more useful to look at a whole series of rocks laid down over a long period of time as it shows how things changed, rather than just a single snapshot. All this is summarised in a song play on the keyboard and sung in harmony: Geology's like travelling in time...

## Risk Assessment

('Description', 'Pour sand into a tank, then overlay with various colours of play-doh, eventually injecting a coloured liquid through the side', 'Cut the layers of play-doh in the tank with a knife and offset them, also folding other parts', 'Get a toy dinosaur out of the toybox (after throwing out some other toys) and get an audience member to make imprints of the dinosaur in the play-doh', 'Get the audience to hold up pieces of paper and turn them over. Either project view of audience with a camera or get a few audience memebrs down to the front to do this', 'Showing the samples to the audience via the projector and an audience member feeling the inside of the fulgurite', 'Some flashing lights, occasional sounds and a song from a keyboard', 'Hazard', 'Sand/liquid could get on the floor and make it slippy  Liquid could get on electrical parts', 'Knife could cut presenter or audience member if left unattended', 'Toys could hit audience members  Audience member could drop toy dinosaur on foot  Audience coming down to the front could trip', 'Audience coming down to the front could trip  Paper cut from turning paper over', 'Handling heavy rocks and may drop on the floor/feet  Audience member could cut finger on sharp  parts of fulgurite', 'Loud music and bright flashing lights may cause damage to eyes and ears, or may cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.')

<br/>

('Action To Be Taken To Minimise Risks', 'Keep all substances within the tank and other containers, and also within a tray  Mop up any spillages promptly  Keep electrical equipment away from any liquids', 'Keep knife in a holder and make sure it is never left unattended. Concentrate when cutting', 'Throw only lightweights toys behind in a careful fashion  Get audience member to hold the toy dinosaur carefully in two hands and place carefully back on the table  Say to watch out for cables on the way to the floor and then make sure there are no cables in the demonstration area. Gaffer loose cables down if necessary', 'Say to be careful with the paper  Say to watch out for cables on the way to the floor and then make sure there are no cables in the demonstration area. Gaffer loose cables down if necessary', 'Hold rocks carefully in two hands and place carefully back on the table  Make sure the audience member just touches the smooth part and tell them to be careful', 'Keep the music at a low sound level and the lights at a low level, warning people that there will be some flashing lights')
