## Equipment Needed

**This experiment can take place outdoors**
In this box there should be:
• Lots of Plushies

## Explination
The idea of this experiment is along the same lines as Animal Skulls, Bugs Life and Cuddly Microbes. We present a range of props (in this case dinosaur plushies) and ask children to make comparisons

With dinosaurs we can do several interesting groups/sorts:
• Carnivore / Herbivore / Omnivore 
• Oldest to Newest (sort in eras)
• Biggest to Smallest (since plushies arent to scale)

Compared to some demos the science here is light however this would be a very attention grabbing demo.

## Todo
• Find plushies - ideally thinking about the categories
• Write fact file matching each plushie
• Calculate the groupings/orderings
• Print some pictures

## Building Info
**Cost** - Estimated £200 for minimal demo of 12 toys

The only complexity is finidng accurate enough toys to make this demo sciencable. The following seems to be good sources (at least to a mathematician).

This seems to get one of each available - however one could easily spend another £100 getting a few non other prehistoric animals or doubling up some dinosaurs.
With another £100 buying £60 more from Living Nature World and the rest doubling up some dinosaurs from IKEA would be worth it.
