## What it Looks Like
The parts of this experiment that exist are in a translucent pinky/purple crate (this is not a usual CHaOS box).

The box is deceptively heavy and contains a liner which is full of sand. All ofher pieces can be discovered in the sand.

## Equipment Needed 
- Lots of Sand
- Fossils
- (Optional) Mini Paleontology tools (trowel, toothbrush, dental pick, screen, tape measure)
- Pictures of the dinosaurs that are represented (plus cool fossil pictures where requires), size comparisons, geologic ages.


## Learning Goals
- Talk a group through a number of different animals alive during the Mesozoic – the era of the dinosaurs (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, 250-65 million years ago).
- Find out what fossils are and how they form.
- Give children an idea of the sorts of animals that were alive during this time, and of how we work things out about those animals.

## Design Theory
Dinosaurs themselves are quite interesting amd we add to that by inckuding the digging and paleontology 
This demo opens up new discussion topics like how we identify fossils of unknown animals.
While an optional novelty the sand acts to slow down finding the fossils amd the sometimes overwhelming nature of having everything on the table.
Using 3D prints and small fossils makes this demo cheap. We don't mind children touching ant of the pieces as theyre easily replaced.
The sand grabs attention not a big expensive fossil.

## Experiment Description 
Here are some general pointers for running the experiment:
- At some point it is a good idea to ask children if they know what fossils are and how they form. If they aren’t too sure, explain how hard parts of animals – teeth, bones, shells – can be buried under layers of sediments, and eventually become fossilised. However, plants, footprints, tree sap and excrement can all be fossilised too. The fossil we see may be as it originally was, it may have recrystallised, or it may be an imprint. (Hopefully there will be some examples you can pick out for each of these types and they can be indicated here) The details of fossilisation processes are actually very complicated, but fortunately a general idea of what happens is sufficient.
- An awkward question I have been asked a few times is how do we know that a given fossil is 80 million years old? This is a hard one to answer. If children are old enough to understand Carbon-dating, you can make an analogy with this, since most of the fossils are old enough to be dated using Uranium decay.  Otherwise you may have to make do with talking about relative dating using layers of sedimentary rocks. There are also lots of other ways.
- Children rarely get to see fossils up close, and when they do they are usually behind a glass barrier in a museum. Please encourage them to pick these specimens up, look at them, feel them, and engage as scientists in trying to work out what they are!
- You may like to talk about why there are no dinosaurs alive today. The leading theory for the cause of their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous is a meteorite impact, although some scientists favour linking it to a huge amount of volcanism in India which produced a vast quantity of lava now known as the Deccan Traps. Either event would have altered the climate by throwing up debris or ash into the air which may have blocked out the sun, but the volcanism would also have greatly increased CO2 levels, further contributing to rapid climate change. Technically, you could argue that not all dinosaurs are extinct – birds, which evolved from dinosaurs like Velociraptor during the Jurassic, could be called dinosaurs.
- You may also like to talk about the differences between herbivores and carnivores: carnivores tend to have forward facing eyes for better depth perception; herbivores have outward-facing eyes to spot predators. Carnivores have sharp teeth to tear into flesh, herbivores have flat teeth to grind up tough plants. An easy task for younger children is sorting fossils by what they eat in this fashion.
- You may end up being asked the question “are these real?” Only some of these specimens are actual fossils – the rest are casts or 3D-prints of real fossils, so look exactly the same. You can probably tell the difference in weight between casts and real fossils, but I have included in the descriptions of the fossils which they are.
- If children ask where these fossils are from, I’ve tried to include details in the description. Lots of British fossils come from along the coastlines of Dorset and NE England, as this is where cliffs of Mesozoic aged sedimentary rocks can be found.


There are a few possible ways to demonstrate this experiment, feel free to try and adapt any combination of these:
- Take out fossils one by one, pass them round, ask questions about them to see what the children can work out for themselves, and then tell them what they are, and show them a picture if we have one. All of these animals were alive during the Mesozoic, but not at the same time. 
- Put all the fossils on the table, get children to take turns to pick a fossil, pass them round and discuss. This way there’s more risk of children trying to grab lots of fossils so it is better with older children.
- Put all the fossils in the sand pit and get children to excavate them like they’re a real palaeontologist (ish). You can try and layer fossils based on the era, if you do this then putting a piece of paper in between layers stops children digging past the current era.

The rest of the description talks through each fossil in detail and then some connections between them. (TODO)

###T-Rex
67-65 million years ago (Late Cretaceous)
Members of family Tyranosauridae 83-65 million years ago (Late Cretaceous)
Tyrannosaurus, or T-Rex, was a huge carnivorous dinosaur, measuring up to 13 metres long, and chasing after prey on its powerful hind legs. Its sharp teeth made easy work of prey, and its tiny arms may have been used to grasp this prey and prevent it from escaping. Whether or not this is correct, they were certainly not useless, as they have been shown to be strong and muscled. T-Rex was most likely both a powerful hunter and a scavenger.
It has been suggested (e.g. Planet Dinosaur TV series) Tyrannosaurids and Ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs like Triceratops) simultaneously grew in size over the course of the Late Cretaceous to out-compete each other, the Ceratopsians getting larger and improving their defensive horns, and the Tyrannosaurs becoming bigger and more deadly.
Since some early Tyrannosaurids have been shown to have “protofeathers”, it has been suggested that T-Rex may too have had them. However, its large size probably meant that they were unnecessary – like large animals such as elephants today, they would not have needed any extra coating such as feathers to stay warm enough. Still, perhaps they had some remaining protofeathers rather than a full body covering?

### Plesiosaur/Pliosaur
200-65 million years ago (Early Jurassic – Late Cretaceous)
Plesiosaurs and pliosaurs were closely related marine lizards that ranged in size from around 2-20m. They had sharp teeth and powerful jaws, and preyed upon a variety of other marine animals depending on their size, possibly including ammonites, fish, and other plesiosaurs. The main difference between Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs is that Plesiosaurs have longer necks and smaller heads. The Loch Ness Monster is based on a Plesiosaur.

### Brachiosaurus
Late Jurassic (154-150 million years ago)
Estimated to be 18-22m long and 28-47 tons.

- Skull, 3D print

### Velociraptor
Late Cretacious (75-71 million years ago)
Mostly lived in asia and about 1.5-2m long and only weighing 15-18kg. They had a big sickle shaped claw on each hind food designed to tackle and restrain prey. They also likely had feathers. More the size of a turkey than what you see on Jurrasic Park.

## Todo
- Check which fossils have been printed and are still there. I believe they're the ones listed above.
- Supplement with some more prints and/or by buying some cheap real fossils.
- Add fossil info to the experiment description - I've included some info copied from Dinosaurs and their Ocean Friends/Rocks and Fossils/other experiments but this is vauge.
- Fossils may want numbering for easy identification 
- Print pictures of dinosaur to match fossils as required
- Find some tools for digging (a cheap pack of toothbrushws should do for starters)
- Should probably add scale info to fossil descent 

## Building Info
This is mostly a list of 3D prints I'm aware of that fit this experiment.
Some of these I have printed (but may have lost).
The idea is to use cheap fossils we dont mind being extensively handled - but including a job lot of real ones would not be against this idea

## Additional Content
Theres likely enough content here for a whole experiment however some other ways to (temporarily) complete it could be:
- Use plastic toy dinosaurs (hopefully accurate) and match them to fossils or just cheaply expand that way by burying some plastic dinosaurs. This encroaches on Cuddly Dinosaurs.
- Could talk more about environments where we find fossils and other remains. Things like sedimentary rock are good for bones and teeth but we can get soft tissues in places like peat bogs and ice. We could take this further by making some ice fossils for contrast - would just need some freezable bits (could 3D print some small brains) and then drop them in ice cube molds, freeze in advance and use one per group to mention this. Could then put some rock samples kn the sand.
- Geological Scarf - Make a long scarf (or similar) and divide it up into colors based on geographic period. The one I have seen is 30m long and had something like 6cm of scarf per million years, thus going back to some time in the Cambrian Era. This then shows how short a period we’ve been around for  and you can sort fossils into places on the scarf. The scarf is also helpful for protecting fragile fossils.
