# Handy Engineering

**Build a small working model hand from card and straws!** - Build a model of the inner workings of your hand! Learn about how muscles and tendons work together to control the movements of our fingers, and have a model to take home, made of simple household objects!

## Equipment Needed 
- Drinking straws
- Sellotape
- A4 card
- Printout attached below
- String

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

1. Cut out around the hand.
2. Collect 5 pre-cut straws.
3. Tape down a piece of string over the end of each finger.
4. Thread a pre-cut straw onto each piece of string.
5. Using the sticky tape secure the straw between each of the joints.
6. Cut the straws a little way below the bottom of the fingers.
7. Cut another 5 short segments of straw and tape these by the wrist of your hand model.
8. Thread each piece of string through a separate straw.


You can also demo with a "How science works" theme if you have no clue about "how the hand" works. We study various models of how the hand works of various complexities. The paper model we make is simple but has more flaws than the more complicated Hand Model. You can get them to try and recreate motions on the two models and their actual hand and look for muscles moving.

What does the model show?

The strings running up each of the fingers represent the tendons of muscles that originate in the forearm and insert onto the distal phalanges of each finger. 
The main muscle is flexor digitorum profundus that flexes the distal interphalangeal joints (between the phalanges of the fingers) and metacarpophalangeal joints (between proximal phalanx of finger and metacarpal bone of hand). 
When the muscle contracts it pulls on the tendons, bending the fingers at each of the joints.
Damage to the tendons will compromise flexion of the fingers.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Scissors

**Description**: Risk of cuts.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Younger children should be accompanied by an adult. CHaOS volunteers to oversee carefully.
Ensure kids are behaving sensibly at all times. Use safety scissors. Call a first aider in the event of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
