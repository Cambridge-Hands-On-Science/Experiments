## Experiment Explanation 

**In a nutshell:**


Talk about different blood groups and why it is important to match blood for transfusion. Demonstrate how different blood groups are compatible using the food colouring, and use the laminated cells and antibodies as props for explanation.

**How to set up the experiment:**  
Make up some A, B, AB and O ‘blood’ in the universal containers as follows:
- A: 2 drops red food colouring in 20ml water
- B: 4 drops blue food colouring in 20ml water
- AB: 2 drops red and 4 drops blue colouring in 20ml water
- O: water

Take four 4-well plates and lay them out in a square. Put about 1ml of A blood in each of the 4 wells in the first column, 1ml of B in the second, 1ml of AB in the third and 1ml of O in the fourth column. These represent the recipient blood.  
You can then get the children to add about 4 drops of each blood type from the 20ml tubes to each of the types in the plates (so add 4 drops of A to each of the wells in the top row, 4 drops B to each in the second row etc). These represent the donor blood.   
It is worth testing this at first to check that your colouring concentrations give the results that you want! The idea is that if the colour of the ‘blood’ in the well changes, the blood groups are incompatible. If it doesn’t change, they are compatible. For example, adding B (blue) blood to AB (purple) will not cause a colour change, but adding B to O (clear) will.   

The laminated cells and antibodies can be laid out in areas corresponding to each blood group. The contents of one area can then be transferred into another area (a transfusion) and any matches between the antibodies/antigens observed. 

**Background information:**  
(From www.blood.co.uk)  
The most important blood groups in transfusion are the ABO blood group system and the RhD blood group system.   
Blood groups are determined by a protein (antigen) on the surface of the red cell. So, the ABO system has A and B antigens and the RhD system has the D antigen.  
In all, there are 30 major blood group systems. This means a person may be A RhD positive, and at the same time Kell (Kell system) positive, M and N (MNS system) positive and Lea and Leb (Lewis system) positive.

**The ABO blood group system**  
Blood group A - you have got the A antigen on your red cells  
Blood group B  - you have the B antigen  
Blood group O - you have neither antigen  
Blood group AB - you have both A and B antigens  
The ABO system has associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies, antibodies being the body's natural defence against foreign antigens. These antibodies are found in the plasma.  
Blood group A will recognise the B antigen as foreign and can make anti-B antibodies against the B antigen.  
Similarly, blood group B will recognise the A antigen as foreign and can make anti-A antibodies against it.  
Group AB has both the A antigen and the B antigen so this group makes no antibodies.  
Group O has neither A nor B antigen so blood from this group can be given safely to any other group. This is why Group O donors are known as "universal donors". Group O individuals can make both anti-A and anti-B antibodies if exposed to these antigens so can't receive blood from either.  
Giving someone blood from the wrong ABO group could be life-threatening. For instance, the anti-A antibodies in group B attack group A cells and vice versa. This is why group A blood must never be given to a group B person.  

For transfuions of packed red blood cells (so no antibodies transferred as these are in plasma):
- AB individuals - RBCs have both A and B antigens and blood plasma does not contain antibodies against A or B. Can therefore receive blood from any group (**universal recipients**), but cannot donate blood to either A or B group  
- A individuals - RBCs have A antigen and blood plasma has anti-B IgM antibodies. Can therefore receive blood from group A or group O individuals (A is preferrable), and can donate blood to group A or group AB individuals  
- B individuals - RBCs have B antigen and blood plasma has anti-A IgM antibodies. Can therefore receive blood from group B or group O individuals (B is preferrable), and can donate blood to group B or group AB individuals 
- O individuals - RBCs don't have A or B, but blood plasma contains both anti-A and anti-B IgM antibodies. Can therefore only receive blood from group O individuals, but can give blood to any ABO group (A, B, O, or AB group) - are **universal donors**  
If a patient in a hospital situation were to need a blood transfusion in an emergency, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O Negative blood can be issued  

**What about plasma?**  
Plasma is the liquid component of blood that doesn't contain any cells. Recipients can receive plasma of the same blood group, but otherwise the donor-recipient compatibility for blood plasma is the converse of that of RBCs - plasma extracted from type AB blood can be transfused to individuals of any blood group because it won't contain any antibodies against A or B antigens; individuals of blood group O can receive plasma from any blood group; and type O plasma can be used only by type O recipients.

**The RhD system**  
Another important blood group system in transfusion is the RhD system.  
85% of people have the D antigen on their red blood cells and are RhD positive.  
The remaining 15% lack the D antigen and are RhD negative.  
Your blood group is defined by your ABO group together with your RhD group. For instance, someone who is group A and RhD negative is known as A negative.  

| ABO Blood Group | Rh(D)Type | Percentage of Population with this Group |
|---|---|---|
| O + | Pos | 37% |
| O - | Neg | 7% |
| Total Blood Type O | 44% |
| A + | Pos | 35% |
| A - | Neg | 7% |
| Total Blood Type A | 42% |
| B + | Pos | 8% | 
| B - | Neg | 2% |
| Total Blood Type B | 10% |
| AB + | Pos | 3% |
| AB - | Neg | 1% |
| Total Blood Type AB | 4% |
| Total Pos | 83% |
| Total Neg | 17% |


**Why is the Rhesus system important for pregnant ladies?**  
Unlike A and B antibodies, RhesusD antibodies are not found in people who are RhesusD negative. Therefore they won’t react to RhesusD positive blood unless they have already been sensitised. If a RhD- mother has a RhD+ foetus (only possible if the father is RhD+), feto-maternal transfusion may occur during pregnancy/childbirth, causing the mother to produce anti-RhD antibodies. If the mother subsequently has a second Rh+ pregnancy, the anti-RhD antibodies can cross the placenta and cause agglutination and degradation of the red blood cells in the foetus. This causes ‘haemolytic disease of the newborn’, features of which include enlarged liver, spleen or heart in the foetus and anaemia, jaundice, enlarged organs and difficulty breathing in the newborn. To prevent this, RhD- mothers can be given IgG anti-D antibodies by intramuscular injection. These antibodies then cause destruction of foetal RhD+ blood cells before the maternal immune system can react to them. These are administered at 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes 34 weeks and within 72 hours of birth. This is passive immunity and wears off after 4-6 weeks so treatment is required with each pregnancy. 

**Why do people have antibodies against the A and B antigens if they don’t have those antigens themselves?**  
It's thought that blood groups are very similar to some bacterial/food sugars which act as antigens so you get cross reactivity. Because ABO antigens are expressed quite widely in tissues (all endothelium and all epithelial cells, and other cell types express the H antigen which is a precursor and can still react with antibody) your natural tolerance mechanisms kick in to protect the sugar you do have, but obviously not to the ones you don't.  

**How can blood group be used to determine paternity?**  
BE CAREFUL discussing this! **Do not ask the parents for their blood groups!**   
From www.transfusion.com.au:  

The ABO blood group system is determined by the ABO gene, which is found on chromosome 9. The four ABO blood groups, A, B, AB and O, arise from inheriting one or more of the alternative forms of this gene (or alleles) namely A, B or O.  

Blood group Possible genes:  
- A - AA or AO
- B - BB or BO
- AB - AB
- O - OO  
The A and B alleles are codominant so both A and B antigens will be expressed on the red cells whenever either allele is present. O alleles do not produce either A or B antigens, thus, are sometimes called ‘silent' alleles.

| Parental blood groups | Child's blood group |
|---|---|
| O and O | O |
| O and A | O or A |
| O and B | O or B |
| O and AB | A or B |
| A and A | A or O |
| A and B | O or A or B or AB |
| A and AB | A or B or AB |
| B and B | O or B |
| B and AB | B or A or AB |

**Description**: Slip hazard.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: All spills should be cleared up immediately, get children to be careful using pipettes. Call first aider in case of injury. Use wet floor sign if necessary.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Fake blood

**Description**: Feeling faint at sight of fake blood/ discussion of blood.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Remind people that the blood isn't real and ask them to tell you if they feel faint. Chair nearby for light-headed-feeling people ask them to sit down and remove 'blood' from line of site. If they feel very faint ask them to sit on the floor to remove risk of falling of chair. Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
