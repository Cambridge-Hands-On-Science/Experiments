## Equipment Needed 
- Oil and pyrex experiment (+ maybe lenses)
- Wave machine (requires tape, skewers, and small masses [e.g. jelly babies, plasticine balls])

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

A few demos on the effects that boundaries have on propagating waves, the general theme being 'waves cross boundaries easily if the properties on either side match'. This demonstration is kept in its own box inside Oil and Pyrex, because that is what it will most commonly be used alongside.

Wave machine:
Good for going over wave basics and the concept of wave impedance (how much force it takes to create a certain response from the moving object). 
Make by stretching gaffer between two tables, and evenly space skewers along it (it helps to mark the skewers' midpoints in advance). Stick another layer of tape on the top to secure the skewers, and put weights on their ends. The heavier and further away the weights are, the higher the impedance and the slower the wave will be.

You can play with skewer spacing and weight positions to vary the impedance and create boundaries. You should be able to reflect a wave of one of these boundaries, and the difference in wave speed should be noticeable. Note that the tape will stretch, and will need tightening every so often

The rest of the experiment is basically just Oil+Pyrex, and oven shelf.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Skewers

**Description**: Ends of skewers could be sharp (could stab/cut people)

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Don't set up in a high-traffic area (where people might walk through it), and make sure people don't lean in close. Ends of skewers have plastic on to reduce pointiness.
Call a first aider in the case of an injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

### **Hazard**: Swallowing sweets/marshmallows

**Description**: Audience could try to eat them, which is unsanitary.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Keep an eye on children, and mention not to eat the sweets or Plasticine
In the event that something is eaten, warn parents/relevant adult to take the child to the GP if ill.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

### **Hazard**: Oil and Pyrex

**Description**: Assorted risks due to Oil and Pyrex demonstration.

**Affected People**: -

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: -, Severity: -, Overall: -

**Mitigation**: See separate RA for Oil and Pyrex.
Follow procedures in Oil and Pyrex.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: -, Severity: -, Overall: -
