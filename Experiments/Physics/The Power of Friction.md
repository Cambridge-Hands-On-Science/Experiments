## Equipment Needed

- Two large interleaved books attached to ropes

## Experiment Explanation

<!-- Here are some example headings to follow, but feel free to ignore these and / or make your own! -->
Explain that friction is the force which acts when two surfaces move relative to one another, for example when pushing a block of wood along a table. When there is a larger surface area in contact, the amount of friction experienced will be greater, so pushing wider block along a table will be harder than a smaller one.

You could demonstrate that when the books have only one or two pages touching, only a small amount of force is required to separate them. Try to show that the more pages that are in contact (i.e. the higher the surface area of contact), the more force is required to overcome the power of friction acting. A separate pair of books, or individual sheets of paper could be used for the early demonstrations, to save time interlocking the pages for the tug of war.


For the final demonatration, interlock as many pages as possible.
Have people try to pull them apart in a tug-of-war fashion. It's basically impossible as there is a huge surface area of contact between the books. Have the tug-of-war be 1 vs 1 to limit forces, getting them to take turns (or demonstrators/adults can do the tug-of-war if kids are too young/irresponsible).

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Uneven/cluttered space

**Description**: Falling over, leading to injury, especially if ground is hard.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (Medium)

**Mitigation**: Only perform in a clear/soft area free from trip hazards. Use sensible volunteers of reasonably even strength so one can't pull the other over.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Book breaking

**Description**: Falling over.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (Medium)

**Mitigation**: Check condition of both books before use. Only allow 1 *vs* 1 to limit forces.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (Low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Books

**Description**: Papercuts

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (Medium)

**Mitigation**: Encourage people just to handle the strings, not the books themselves. Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (Low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Rope

**Description**: Rope burn

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (Medium)

**Mitigation**: Inspect strings before use. Don't wrap strings around limbs

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (Low)
