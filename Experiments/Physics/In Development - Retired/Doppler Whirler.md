# Doppler Whirler

**Spin me round** - You spin me right round, baby, like a doppler whirler, baby, right round round round
All I know is that you'll hear the pitch shifts as this spins round

## Equipment Needed 
- Doppler Whirler x 2
- Doppler Stretch band

## Experiment Explanation 

As objects move relative to our ears we hear changes in frequency due to red and blue shift. This is why ambulances sound different before and after they pass you. 
The frequency is higher during the approach and lower during the going away bit. When the whirler is spinning around you can hear this. Stop the whirler and the tone is nearly constant! 
Talk about red shift blue shift in galaxies and other occurrences of this.

This is mainly designed to be noisy and grab people's attention, there's not a massive amount of science you can show with it, although you could also take some simple models of why. If you want to go into more details then this is where the Doppler Stretch comes in, this is a band with a wave drawn on it, get children to pull the band and see what happens to the waveform on it. Compare the distance between the peaks of the waves (wavelength), stretching increase the wavelength. The frequency is how many waves per second, if they're longer wavelength there is less per second as they travel at the same speed! This is red shift. You can use the measuring side of the reaction rulers to measure with. 

If you want to ramble on about science there are lots of uses of the Doppler effect in astrophysics which you could look up to satisfy your rambling needs. If you do you can then write them in this gap and someone will type them up...

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Whirler (impact)

**Description**: Main risk is hitting a person and injuring them by either accidentally letting go of the whirler or hitting someone close to you.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Attach the thing to your arm to prevent losing grip on it. Ensure adequate space around you before swinging it. Ask people to move out of the way and alert them to what you're doing. Don't do it in a thoroughfare and stay out of the path of other people. Foam coat the whirler to minimise any damage from impacts.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Whirler (noise)

**Description**: Noise may upset very young or vulnerable children. It's 140 db - that's like being on an aircraft carrier deck. 120dB is a chainsaw and is classed as 'Painfully Loud' and this is 4 x 'Painfully Loud'. The good news is 150dB is 'Eardrum Rupture Loud' and this is only half as loud as that, we do have two though.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 5, Severity: 5, Overall: 25

**Mitigation**: Warn people that the demo makes a strange noise. Always check with parents. Stop if a child becomes distressed by the experiment. SOMEHOW MAKE IT QUIETER. Maybe solder a resistor between the battery terminals or just in series with the battery, always use a battery that's going to die soon. Make everyone within 50m wear ear protection. Don't loose the pull cord, if you do get the sledgehammer. Tape foam over the speaker outputs directly to try and muffle it. This all hasn't been done yet.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 5, Severity: 5, Overall: 25

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Stretch band

**Description**: Children may be allergic to band material (latex). Band may snap or release under tension.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Use a latex free band, children are unlikely to have immediate reaction to band. Use resistance or exercise band designed for frequent tension, replace when showing signs of wear. Ensure band is not over stretched. Make sure children are sensible and don't release band under tension.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
