## Experiment Explanation 

Doing various static electricity and magnetic experiments, to show their properites and similarities.

- Playing with magents, they have North and south poles.
-- The effect of magents on iron, iron filings etc

- Charging up balloons, and polystyrene, what do they do to other things, do they always attract.

- applying a charged thing to corflour vegetable oil mix - it makes it go hard in the same way as applying a magnet to iron filings makes them go stiffer.

- ferrofluid, - we have some, you can make analagies if you like, it is cool.

- charging things by earthing them near another charged thing

- Kelvin water drop experiment - this would be very good for smart alec kids or parents, it charges up drops of water just by them falling by electrostatic influence, it basically magnifies

## Risk Assessment

('RISKS', 'Strong magnets could finger trap, or shatter when colliding  Vegetable oil could cause a slip hazard if spilt  Kelvin drop model will spray drops of water up to a metre possibly causing an electrical hazard  Kelvin drop model will generate enough voltage/charge to give a shock smaller than you would get from a nylon jumper  ferrofluid stains horribly')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS', "Only use one strong magnet at a time and cover in gaffer tape to absorb collisions  Clear up any spills  Make sure that any electrical equipment/sockets nearby is covered with plastic. Be aware of how far they are going.  Encourage children Not to touch it as it may hurt.  It should be in a container, don't open the container")

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT', 'Call first aider in case of injury.')
