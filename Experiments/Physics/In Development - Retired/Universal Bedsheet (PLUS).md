## Experiment Explanation 

Stretch the bed sheet between tables, you want a taught unsupported are in the middle. Using a few lengths of wood, two tables and several clips this is doable.

The sheet here models a 2D version of space, we get this from looking straight down from above the sheet. While it curves downwards in our view we can't see this from above (other than stretch marks in the sheet, we call this constriction). So when we put a mass (this is a planet) on the sheet we don't really see a change. What could we see on the sheet? Place a small ball bearing near by and it rolls towards it. From our 2D view the ball has moved for no reason. From everything else we know about movement there must be a force, we can't see this force but by experimenting it definitely exists. We call this force gravity. 

One thing we look at in these situations is symmetry. Assuming these masses are all perfect spheres we'd expect the gravity around them to be the same in all directions, we call this spherically symmetric with no preferred direction. What if we spun the ball, could that have an effect? Who knows, but we should get symmetry around the axis it's spinning in. 

You can also talk about the whole geometry of this situation, what is a straight line on the bed sheet? well that's interesting.

We can do some checks on this, one places super accurate clocks on different floors of sky scrapers, those further away from the earth experience fractionally more time. 

You can also fling balls at different speeds and get an understanding of why we get orbits and collapse.

Black holes are commonly represented by singularities in this model, here the sheet has a really tiny, infinitely heavy mass on it causing anything near it to just fall into the hole.

There are issues with this demo, gravity is a curvature of space-time, which is a 4D thing, so we have two dimensions missing. It's also mainly a time dilation.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Tripping

**Description**: Gravity causes people to trip over the structure supporting space-time or run away planets.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Use hazard tape to highlight structure supporting the bedsheet. Place balls onto the sheet and encourage children not to run in the vicinity of the model.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Structure Collapsing

**Description**: If not secured appropriately, the structure could collapse and drop the balls, or injure someone in the process.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Ensure the support is secure. Test out with the balls before beginning demonstrating. Check regularly that security of the structure has not been compromised.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Person collides with ball

**Description**: Face (or other child part) collides with ball thrown by demonstrator/other children.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Choose balls appropriately. Ensure children behave while using model.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Marbles

**Description**: Risk of choking

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Supervise small children when using small parts of the model and don't let them put anything in their mouths. Call a first aider if an incident occurs and perform the Heimlich manouver if trained and confident to do so.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5
