# Mould Effect (Self-Siphoning Beads) 

**Letting a chain pull itself out of a beaker under its own gravity** - Why on earth do the beads have to go up to come down?! Watch them fly out of a beaker, looping and corkscrewing, and find out about the amazing Mould Effect!

## Equipment Needed 
- **This experiment can take place outdoors**
- 25m chain of metal beads (in 5m sections)
- A shorter length of chain
- Lidded pot/beaker to store them in and siphon them out of
- Something to wrap the chain round (e.g a reel) in order to stop it getting tangled in storage.

**Method:**

Place the chain inside the beaker, hold the beaker in your hand then throw one end over the side so that the end outside the beaker is longer than the section going between the top of the beaker and the coiled up chain (so that gravity is able to pull the rest of the chain out of the beaker). For the small plastic beaker currently in the box, 15cm works best.

Let go and watch as the rest of the chain flies out of the beaker, producing a surprisingly wide arc into the air as it goes. If you're lucky you may see coils and loops, appearing to be frozen in space even as the chain continues to move.

The effect may be more pronounced if the beaker is placed higher up away from the ground â€“ the chain arc clearly rises above the rim of the beaker and goes out without touching the beaker. 

**Explanation:**

The weight of the chain outside the beaker is greater than that of the free section inside the beaker, so the chain is pulled out, at some speed. However, due to Newton's 1st and 2nd laws, the individual beads of the chain can't change direction instantaneously. Instead, it takes a continuous force pulling them round in a circle until they are travelling downwards towards the floor - hence the arc. 

If the chain hits the side of the beaker as it's doing this, the disturbance will attempt to travel away from the point of contact - i.e. back towards the bottom of the beaker. However, the chain is moving fast enough to counteract this, and so the net effect is that this disturbance barely moves. This is the reason for the standing coils and loops you might observe (it may be that the wave velocity equals the speed of the chain at this point, but I'd have to check this).

**Further Points:**
You could try drawing an analogy with siphoning a liquid using a long hose/straw.

**Floating**
This experiment can work well for floating however, you'll want to use the short chain and be careful not to fiddle while carrying it else you'll tie it in knots. 2 goes is probably sufficient for a 5 minute demo and ask them to think about the forces, gravity and acceleration before trying it. Bring in momentum for advanced groups and talk about needing all the beads to move at the same speed and how they can't change direction instantly. Analogy with running round a corner and needing a wide bend to keep the same speed (400m running track).

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Beaker

**Description**: The beaker may fall and hit someone.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Do not hold directly above anyone. Do not use glass beakers; use plastic to avoid any cuts.

Call a first aider in the case of an injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Beads

**Description**: The beads may hit someone.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ask audience to step back (at least 1m) to avoid being hit and hold the beaker away from your body. If standing elevated  to demonstrate then ask audience to stand back further. Do NOT carry out in a crowded space. Make sure audience is paying attention. Pick up the beads yourself after it finishes, do not let children play with it.

In case of injury, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Beads

**Description**: The beads present a strangulation risk. Either through latching onto someone or children playing with them.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Ask audience to step back (at least 1m) to avoid being hit and hold the beaker away from your body. Do NOT carry out in a crowded space. Make sure audience is paying attention. Pick up the beads yourself after it finishes, do not let children play with it.

In case of injury, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Chain on floor

**Description**: Trip hazard due to beads on floor.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Tidy up the beads as soon as the demonstration finishes. Ask viewers to step back until you're done. Potentially siphon beads into a large tray.

Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Chain

**Description**: If swallowed the chain presents a choking hazard.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Do not let anyone play with the beads or place them in their mouth.

If a long length has been swallowed, do NOT attempt to pull it back out, but cut off the free end. Call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Nickel

**Description**: Possible allergic reactions.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Do not let anyone play with the beads or place them in their mouth.
Check with audience that none are allergic to nickel.
Do not demonstrate if you are allergic to nickel.
Call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Heights

**Description**: Demonstrator falls from chair/high place.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Do not climb onto very high places; a step or perhaps a chair (if safe) is plenty. If standing on a chair or at the top of steps then ensure firm footing and descend before explaining. Do not climb onto tables or other high places. Only do one elevated demonstration per group to avoid getting on/off the chair whilst distracted by explaining.

Call a first aider in case of emergency.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
