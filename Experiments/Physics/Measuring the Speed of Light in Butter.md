## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- Microwave
- Cardboard
- Butter/Margarine/Cheap Spread (alt. chocolate, anything melty, wax could work and be reusable?)
- Ruler

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

- Explain how light is a wave and that microwaves are just some wavelength of this. A microwave has a generator (called a magnetron), standing waves are formed in the oven box, and the nodes and antinodes have different energy levels. Microwave turntable rotation means food gets heated evenly. (Antinodes provide maximum heat, nodes have no heating except diffusion).
- Remove the turntable from the microwave, this allows us to identify the hotspots. To do so take some cardboard/paper plate and spread a fine layer of butter evenly across it. Place in the microwave for a few seconds. You should notice a pattern in the melted butter, if not keep microwaving it until you see things. 
- Use the ruler to measure the distance between the hotspots: this gives us half the wavelength of microwaves. 
- Then speed of light = wavelength * frequency ($c=f\lambda$). The frequency of microwaves is around 2.5Ghz. 
- The speed of light is 29,979,245,800 cm/sec (as you'll probably measure the distance in cm)
- For thought: how can you improve the accuracy? Choose some other EM wave, better generator, deal with reflection inside the microwave.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Microwave

**Description**: Can cause sparks or explosions if metal is microwaved. The microwave should not be run empty to prevent damage.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Don't put any objects potentially containing metal in the microwave, ever. Only run the microwave if there is something inside it.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Burns

**Description**: Hot things removed from the microwave could cause burns.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Be careful when removing things from the microwave, avoid using bare hands. Microwave for appropriate time and don't over cook. Ensure children are adequately supervised. Allow item to cool before children measure if needed. Run any burns under cool (not cold) running water for at least 20 minutes.

Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Food Contamination

**Description**: Food cooked in the microwave may be contaminated with results of the experiment.

**Affected People**: Demonstrators

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Don't use the microwave for food preparation. Don't eat the butter or chocolate used in the experiment.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Electrical Cables

**Description**: Trip Hazard.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Try to keep cables out of thoroughfare. If cables must be placed somewhere people are likely to be walking, tape them down.

Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
