## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- Microwave
- Cardboard
- Butter/Margarine/Cheap Spread (alt. chocolate, anything melty, wax could work and be reusable?)
- Ruler

## Experiment Explanation 

Explain how light is a wave and that microwaves are just some wavelength of this. A microwave has a generator, the nodes and antinodes have different energy levels, the rotation means food gets heated evenly. (aninodes max heat, nodes have no heating bar diffusion)
Remove the turntable from the microwave, this allows us to identify the hotspots. To do so take some cardboard/paper plate and spread a fine layer of spread evenly across it. Place in the microwave for a few seconds. You should notice a pattern in the melted butter, if not keep microwaving it until you see things. 
Use the ruler to measure the distance between the hotspots. this gives us half the wavelength of microwaves. 
Then speed of light = wavelength * frequency. The frequency of microwaves is around 2.5Ghz. 
The speed of light is 29,979,245,800 cm/sec (as you'll probably measure the distance in cm)
For thought how can you improve the accuracy? Choose some other em wave, better generator, deal with reflection inside the microwave.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Microwave

**Description**: Can cause sparks or explosions if metal microwaved.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Don't put any objects potentially containing metal in the microwave, ever.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Burns

**Description**: Hot things removed from the microwave could cause burns.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Be careful when removing things from the microwave. Microwave for appropriate time and don't over cook. Ensure children adequately supervised. Allow item to cool before children measure if needed. Run any burns under a tepid water for an appropriate length of time.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Food Contamination

**Description**: Food cooked in the microwave may be contaminated with results of the experiment.

**Affected People**: Demonstrators

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Don't use the microwave for food preparation

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
