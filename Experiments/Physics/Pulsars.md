# Pulsars

An experiment to introduce children to pulsars, explain what they are and how they can be used as clocks and to find out about the interstellar medium.

## Equipment Needed 
- **Darkroom needed**
- Pulsar Model
- Sheet of translucent material (I think a sheet of paper may work)

## Experiment Explanation 

Pulsar Experiment/Demonstration

1) Get out model pulsar, preferably in a dark/dim place. Turn on the fairy lights and spin the model around so that the kids get the idea that you can only see the light/emitted radiation when the beam is pointed towards them. Explain that this is because the axis of rotation is different to the axis along which the radiation is emitted. 
2) Explain that these stars spin very fast because they are the remnants of much larger stars that exploded (The sun's rotation period is about 25 days at the equator and 36 at the poles. Caveat: it won't form a pulsar after it dies). These larger stars were spinning much more slowly but, after the explosion, they because much smaller. Hence, to conserve angular momentum, the rate at which they spin had to go up. Make comparison to ice skater/ point at spinny chair if that’s out as well. 
3) Give them some numbers – the range of pulsars’ periods is from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.51 seconds with a typical period being around 1 second. Try and impress upon them how fast this is for a star to be rotating. Earth takes a whole day, so that's 86400 times faster! 
4) Tell them how some kinds of pulsars have such reliable periods that they can be used as clocks. Demonstrate how this would work by using the model. 
5) Get out the screen of translucent material. Ask one of the kids to hold it between the star and the audience and then ask the audience what they notice about the pulses from the star. Hopefully they’ll say that the pulses are less bright. Explain how this means that pulsars can be used to examine the properties of the media that lie between the pulsar and Earth. 

Other talking points:
Explain what a neutron star is/ how one forms. Talk about how all the space between the atoms has been squeezed out and that one teaspoon of neutron star would weigh the same as a mountain. 
How to use pulsar clocks - have seen changes in the frequency due to the effect of planets (in fact this is how the first exoplanet was discovered in 1992, though the more famous first, 51 Pegasi b was the first around a still living star - Mayor & Queloz 1995), also ideas that we could use them to detect gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of spacetime) passing through a large number of them (Pulsar Timing Array)

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Fairy lights inside the model

**Description**: Fairy lights inside model could heat up- potential fire or burn risk

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Turn off fairy lights when model not in use.
In the event of a burn call first aider and run the burn under tepid water for an appropriate amount of time. In the event of fire, follow procedures in venue RA.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

### **Hazard**: Spinning model

**Description**: Could accidentally hit a child with the model while spinning it.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Carry out demonstration at a safe distance from the children. 
Call a first aider in the event of an emergency.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Bright lights

**Description**: Risk of dazzling if child looks directly into the lights

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Tell children not to look straight into the lights. The fairy lights used are very dim.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
