## Equipment Needed 
- Perspex Pipe
- Copper Pipe
- (We don't have but an aluminium pipe would also be useful)
- Some small magnets
- Green Iron Filling Paper

## Experiment Explanation 

Get a volunteer to hold the pipe and challenge them to put the magnet it and catch it as it comes out. If you've got a group ask them if they'd like the copper or perspex pipe, the copper pipe is the much better choice as it means you'll have more time. 

This is because the moving magnet is inducing an electrical current in the metal. There are two ways to explain why this causes it to slow down:

[easier]Some energy is needed to make the electrical current (like turning the handle before). This time the energy comes from the falling magnet, and when it loses kinetic energy it slows down.

[harder]Eddy currents of electricity are formed, and these create an electromagnetic effect opposing the motion of the magnet, hence it slows down.

There is also green 'iron filing' paper, which shows up the movement of a magnet through it. You can use this to 'see' the movement of the magnet inside the copper pipe.

People may say it's to do with the metal being magnetic, but it's really not. Copper is not magnetic, try sticking the magnet to the outside of the tube and it won't.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Magnets

**Description**: Magnets shattering, possibly causing cuts/splinters.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Warn visitors if you give them a magnet.
Use the minimum number of free magnets. Keep the magnets under control.
Cover with tape to reduce impact, and contain any shards.
Pad edges of magnet to reduce finger trap.
Call first aider in case of injury

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Magnets

**Description**: Magnets that are not caught may be a trip hazard or encourage children to dive after them

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Recover magnets quickly but sensibly.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Pipes

**Description**: Any pipe hitting people in face/eye.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator should hold pipe for younger kids and monitor use for others.
Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
