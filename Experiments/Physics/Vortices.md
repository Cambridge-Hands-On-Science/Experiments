## Experiment Explanation 

### **Overview**:

This experiment exhibits vortices, in particular in smoke rings. and vortices in water flowing between 2 bottles.

### **Basic procedure and explanation**:

CARE: Check fire alarm status of the venue - machine shouldn't produce very hot smoke so heat sensor shouldn't be affected however smoke detectors will be. Consider isolating alarms and the risk of doing so in that venue. Alternatively demonstrate outside.
In the event that the alarm goes off, switch off power and follow standard fire procedure (as per venue RA). Open windows and doors to ventilate area.

This experiment is about smoke rings, but, to understand why they happen, it's best to start with something simple, like pouring water between two bottles. Have you ever noticed what water does when it goes down a plughole? Does it just go straight down? With any luck, your audience will have already noticed that it doesn't, but it's still useful to show them a simple vortex in action using the pair of bottles connected by a plastic connector. The water can't just go straight through (because air needs to go the other way), so it forms a vortex and thus air can go straight up through the middle. If you use a lot of water then you'll be able to see the air bubbles coming up followed by a jet of water. 

One experiment you can do is compare two of these bottle setups. Add about 500ml of water to each bottle, the exact amount doesn't matter, however, you'll need the same in each to make it fair and if you add too much water then you'll struggle to get the vortex to form. I found 1L of water required a lot of swirling to get the vortex to form and people may think you're putting in energy to help it go down. You could always try and show this isn't the case by shaking one up and down to give it 'energy' but not help the flow. Then have a race as to which bottle will empty first, turn both bottles over and give one a swirl to encourage the vortex to form. The vortex should be noticeably faster. You may notice that the undisturbed bottle also forms a vortex eventually, 

So far the cores of our vortices (whirlpools) have been roughly straight lines. It's possible to make a vortex the core of which bends back on itself in a circle. You can spin your hand in the air at this point - this demonstrates how awkward the thing is to describe without a real example! Fortunately, we have one - since air is a fluid, like water, we can make a ring of vortex in it. If we use smoke, we'll even be able to see it. This is what the smoke machine is for. Using the smoke machine plug in and hit the button, it has around 3 minute warm up time and high output so only switch it on for a couple of seconds. The vortex cannon should show some good smoke rings. You can also feel the force if you fire it at someone, try not to let people get carried away in a fight, this shows we can transmit force through the air. By stacking the polystyrene cups in a pyramid kids can try to knock them over from a set distance. See how far away this can be done, and note how slowly the ring moves. The smoke shows us this travelling. The sides of the hole in the vortex cannon slow down the smokey air near the sides more than that in the middle, and making a twisting movement all of the way round. This makes a ring of vortex - can you see how it's rotating?

Using a vortex like this we can transmit forces through a fluid over much longer distance than without. See how far you can knock down the cups from, do you think you could easily blow them over from this distance otherwise using just the air? Even if you had a hair drier or a fan to push lots of air it'd probably dissipate over the distance. The moving vortex ring carries the spinning fluid and like a wheel of a car lessens the friction and allows the inner fluid to travel long distances with little loss of mass and kinetic energy.

You can talk about how the smoke machine works. It pulls in the fluid from the tank and heats it causing it to vaporise and form a cloud. The fluid is a mixture of water and glycol or glycerine. You can then talk along the lines of phases of matter and the transition from liquid to gas. You can talk about why we can see the smoke but the normal gases in the air are transparent. This is because the sheer number of water droplets making up the smoke. Normally light is scattered slightly by gases in the air but because there's not that many molecules we can't really see it. The sheer number in the smoke means it's scattered a lot after only a short distance, hence why we can see it. It's a white colour as it scatters all wavelength equally. It's slightly grey because of some of the absorption from the other parts. (I think this is true at least.) 


### **Other things to talk about**:

Pipe smokers can make smoke rings, as can volcanos! You can also see air in water rings from dolphins and scuba divers.

Vortices in air occur in weather systems. Tornados are a particularly vivid example, but there are big, slow vortices as big as whole countries above us in the sky all of the time, determining the direction of the wind.

Eddy shedding and flag ripples are also interesting (apparently) but I don't know anything about them.

Test with another shaped opening by sticking a piece of card over the front of the airzooka, even if you try and do a square you'll find you either form nothing or still get a ring, this is the only stable solution. (If we break an airzooka it could be worth hot knifing it to form a permanent square zooka)

The ring is stable as air in the centre of the vortex is moving faster than the air at the edges, this causes a twisting motion. This shape is stable as fast air is at a lower pressure so in relation to the stationary air at higher pressure there's a force keeping it in a ring. When it slows the pressure difference decreases and the ring expands as the pressure in the ring increases. 

If you touch the ring it breaks as it's a big disruption to the stability. 

You can attempt to get them to interfere and can see some repelling (not sure why it happens though) they can theoretically merge or destroy too but hard to do. The best way to get them to merge seems to be having two people stand next to each other and both fire forwards and slightly together at the same speed. You need the rings to meet along the same plane and spinning in the same direction to interfere constructively.

There's also no net movement of air, think about what this would do to the pressure, air just rotates around the vortex. The smoke is highlighting the forward flow: were we to fill the room with smoke and fire clean air vortices, we'd see reversed motion of smokey air. To try and demo this I have some silicone bracelets, if you imagine these are the smoke ring and then try and roll them along your wrist you'll see that the bracelet spins as it moves. 

Apparently, you can generate smoke rings by shaking an incense stick. You can also do this at home with a coke bottle, a balloon (or small cardboard box) and an incense stick.

In future, we could add a simple plug hole demo to this. Just a waterproof slope with a plug installed and a bucket underneath. You should then be able to disprove some common myths about plugs always draining (counter)clockwise in the northern hemisphere by just doing it a few times. The direction is influenced by the initial angular momentum that gets imparted into the system
