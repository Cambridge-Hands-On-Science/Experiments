## Equipment Needed 
- **This experiment can take place outdoors**
- Pump.
- Bung with hole or with valve.
- Rope
- Launching base.
- A selection of lemonade (or other fizzy drink) bottles
- Lots of water in a large container.
- Preferably another bucket for filling the container.
- _The box also includes some of Dave's 'professional' water rockets, but we currently do not have the right pump for them and these bottles will hurt more if they hit people! For now, the 2L drinks bottles and the old launcher works better_

## Experiment Explanation 

### Setup
Set up the rope running from the launch area to a higher point (raising the launch area, e.g. blocks, can keep the rope above head height) - run the rope through the tube attached to the bottle. Jam the bung in the bottle and get kids to pump until the rocket launches up the rope. Hopefully it should come back down to somewhere you can grab it. Keep people out of the area where the rope is so that they don't get hit by the rocket or walk into the rope! 

As a further point - it can very occasionally be done without the guide rope pointing vertically upwards, or without a guide rope at all. This is suitable in large sports halls or outside only. Here care needs to be taken that a large enough area is cordoned off so that it does not hit anyone when it returns to Earth. If a guide rope is not being used, it can still be helpful to attach a rope to the rocket, in order to limit its range (such as to avoid hitting people) or to aid retrieval.

### Explanation
Water rockets are great fun. Everyone wants a go, from 3 to 13 - and the teenagers and adults too, if they are brave enough to admit it. The does mean that you'll always have a queue and so an interactive discussion is difficult to achieve: on the upside, they'll be back for another try. I always try to remember the faces to keep a line of questioning going from launch to launch. I question them before every launch on a couple of points and while questioning I always keep their rocket in my hand, it keeps their attention and stops a rocket from flying up your ass.

As a first question I always ask: "So how do you think it works?" Which is always a good starter and that gives you your level. If it's not a terribly bad explanation, generally I don't try and correct it or improve it and I let them launch their rockets. Each time they come back a couple more questions maybe a little demo. They very rarely listen to the children ahead of them, which is kind of stupid, but there you go.

Then I suppose I start to refine their understanding of how it works and try and get them to experiment. Trying the bottle, full, empty; the bung in hard, or soft - you have to fiddle this one as it is difficult to control. Indeed you have to fiddle the empty bottle too, you want it to go about 5 feet and catch it, otherwise it can go almost as high as with water.

You've got a couple of lines of questioning. Pressure is always a good one. You can relate it to the pump. As a kid I could never pump up my bicycle tyres, because I didn't push the plunger very far. That sort of inspires me down this line. You can put your thumb over the valve and get them to push down on the plunger, the further they push down the harder it gets. When they let go the air may push it up a little. So that's your basis for explaining what pressure is, how you raise the pressure in the bottle and how it pushes the bung out. Don't use density.

Older kids and adults may talk about molecules. When your talking about molecules you can raise the concept of molecules inside the bottle hitting the inside of the bottle. I quote how fast an air molecule moves, about 500 ms-1, so even though it's light it packs a punch. I crush the bottle, put the bung in and then pump some air in. The bottle comes back to its original state, so the air molecules hitting the wall have pushed it back into shape. Then invite an assistant to squeeze the bottle, it's soft, but as you pump more air in it gets harder and harder, because those air molecules are pushing back at you. It's not a way people generally see the world so it's kind of a fun thing to do.

As part of fully explaining how it works you need the water there to push the rocket up. Every reaction has an opposite but equal reaction. I put the question: "when you lean on a wall and push on it, does it push you back?" All ages generally say no. So on to the demo, lean forward and get an assistant to push on your hand as your wall; "Now, I'm pushing against him and he's pushing against me and I'm going nowhere, what do you suppose happens if he's stops pushing against me." Your assistant stops pushing and you pretend to fly forward. "So if you're pushing against a wall, it must be pushing back."

The more water you've got in the bottle the harder the air pushes it down and the bottle up. So the more water the higher it goes. Sometimes getting them to imagine throwing a tennis ball versus a boulder can help.

Next is the energy. Where is the energy stored? This can lead on nicely to all sorts of questions about conservation of energy and what forms of energy are being converted from launch to launch. So the more air the higher it goes. 

There seems to be a catch 22 situation. Of course it means there is an optimum and this is an important scientific concept in itself. Remember the heavier it is the lower it goes as well. This is all worth expanding on, especially with adults and at this point I may sweeten the pill by saying that on tour "we" settled down to try and work out what the optimum amount of water is, four sides of maths later we still hadn't solved it. The mathematics of how these bottles launch is more complicated than NASA rockets as the thrust changes over time.

The next bit is the bung. This is what really makes it go high or low. "If I push in the bung really hard will it go higher, lower, or not make a difference?"

I even ask the tots questions. I push some air into the bottle and say, "What are these?" Bubbles. "What's in a bubble?" Air, relate to blowing a balloon, what is in a blow? Indeed what's air?

These are just some of the themes I question on and there are plenty more so you shouldn't get bored. Remember, hold that bottle 'til you've got some science into, or out of, them!


### Practicalities
Let them fill their bottles some way away, though you may want another bucket to make your own adjustments to the amount in the bottle. The area around the launch site gets very wet, so move on occasionally. Stay away from roads, people and roofs. Keep the queue back and make sure the rocket isn't angled towards their, or your, face. Bottles may get stuck in trees, that's half the fun.

If you're launching along a rope, you can engineer your setup so that most of the water goes back into the bucket on launch. This will save you some walking!

The more taut the rope is, the less friction the rocket will experience and the further it will go, so tie it to something strong and tie it tight!

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Bottle (projectile), epsecially if flown without rope

**Description**: Hitting people with the bottle

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 5, Severity: 3, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Keep people away from the rope (which the rocket travels on) by blocking off any area where the rope is below head height with chairs, hazard tape or similar. Make sure the person launching the rocket doesn't lean into its path (try to keep the pump as far away from the rocket as the hose will allow - we have lengthened the hose to make this job easier). Also locate the experiment sensibly, bearing in mind walkways that people will want to use in the venue, roads etc and wind direction.

If done without a guide rope, cordon off sufficiently large area to ensure it lands within it. Check prevalent wind direction as well by test firing the rocket before people come.

Wait until the surrounding area is fully clear before launching.

If using the rope to limit range, the areas in which the rocket might land (accounting for prevalent wind direction and lean of the launch stand) must still be cordoned off as there are two hazards - both from the rocket falling on someone and the trip hazard due to the rope.

It is the responsibility of the demonstrator to ensure that the area is clear and there is no chance of the rocket straying into the path of anyone.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Bottle (pressurised)

**Description**: Bottle exploding; debris might cause small cuts or fall on people.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Check bottle for cracks and other damage before use. Any damaged bottles should be cut or marked to show they cannot be used if they cannot be disposed of immediately. Only use 2L "fizzy drink" bottles (Coke, Fanta, etc.) not bottles for still drinks which are not (always) suitable for pressurising.
In the event of an accident call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Rope

**Description**: Walking into/tripping on the rope which the rocket travels on

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Area is fenced off to prevent people from getting too near the bottle, ensuring people do not get too close to the rope as well. Keep rope ends tucked away and off the ground if possible.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Water

**Description**: There is quite a lot of water involved, which presents a slip hazard.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 5, Severity: 2, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Do the experiment outside on a surface that can take water. If done indoors or on a surface which can get slippery, keep a mop close to hand and cordon off the area.

Call a first aider in the case of an injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6
