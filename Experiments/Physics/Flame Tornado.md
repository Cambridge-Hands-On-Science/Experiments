## Equipment Needed 
- Rotating turntable with attached mesh thingy
- Cotton wool & petroleum jelly
- Lighter

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

### Old explanation
Demo of a flame tornado - a small fire is made at the centre of a rotating mesh tube. The tube is rotated giving incoming air angular momentum, so it gets dragged in and makes a cool tornado effect.

To set up place a crucible at the centre of the tray. Let people give it a spin to show a tornado isn't formed like that. Place mesh around and spin again. This messes with incoming air and leads to vortices and tornadoes through scientific magic someone should explain here! 

### New explanation
Ensure the turntable is placed on a flat surface outside. Cover cotton wool with petroleum jelly ahead of demonstrating because a) it's not nice to do and b) it will make demonstrating easier. Place some in the centre of the turntable and (very carefully) light it using the lighter (aim for the cotton wool as the jelly itself isn't flammable and will melt). Make sure people are standing out of the way when you do this! Then, spin the turntable (first without the mesh outside, then with the mesh outside) and you should see a flame tornado when the mesh is present.

### Science explanation
When the mesh isn’t present, the air above the flame mostly moves together as one block. There’s no organised inflow, no shear, and no disturbed motion, so the flame just rises like normal hot gas (hot air goes up, pulls in more air from the sides). 

When the mesh cage is added, everything changes. The air being pulled in at the base is bumped, slowed, and redirected by the mesh, creating differences in air speed and an uneven inflow toward the centre. These speed differences (shear) make the air twist into small rotating columns. As this spinning air spirals inward, it speeds up, like a figure skater pulling their arms in.

When this fast-spinning air reaches the flame, it heats up and rises, carrying its rotation with it. The result is a tall, stable flame tornado.

The flame tornado is higher than the normal flame because the spinning pushes colder, denser air outward, leaving more hot, light air concentrated in the centre. That extra hot air feeds the flame, allowing more combustion and stretching the flame upward.


*hot air balloons and thermals are good examples of this. We might already be running hot air balloons as a separate experiment. You can also show this with the lighter (I'd assume) as the flame will pull upwards regardless of the orientation it's held in (mind your fingers).

**in space stations, with no gravity, flames are much less bright because they can't pull in oxygen like this.

***this is a whole experiment in itself (spinny chair). If they know that ice skaters start spinning wide then pull themselves into the middle to spin faster, or that pulling yourself to the middle of a roundabout makes you spin faster, then that's a reasonable demonstration.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Hot surfaces

**Description**: People, and especially fingers, could get burned if they get into the fire or touch hot surfaces.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Only touch insulated surfaces (i.e. the turntable edge and not the mesh). Keep crowds back to make easier to control. Only to be done by an experienced demonstrator who has practised ahead of time. Audience to be told not to touch the experiment, and demonstrator to avoid continuously running the experiment to minimise contact with the hot mesh.

The mesh cylinder is held onto the turntable very well with screws, and acts as a shield to stop people touching the flame itself, and stops the it from escaping.

Before demonstrating, the demonstrator should make sure the mesh is secure. During the demonstration, they should exercise caution when touching the mesh especially, as it will be very hot when you come back to it. Keep trough of water nearby to submerge the apparatus and cool completely.

In case of accident, run burned areas under cool (not cold) water for at least 20 mins or until it stops hurting - whichever is longer. Summon a first aider immediately to assist the casualty.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (Medium) 

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Burning liquid

**Description**: The burning liquid could escape, and cause a fire/burns.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Be very careful about where it is set up so there is nothing flammable nearby - to be done on a clear piece of flat ground only. The audience should be made to stand well back. Use hazard tape to mark out a perimeter. The demonstrator should maintain a safe distance themselves while demonstrating, keeping long hair tied back and skin covered.

There should be a fire blanket close at hand (safety box).

Petroleum jelly is used because it is viscous so will not fly out too easily

The mesh cylinder is constrained so it remains central.

Smother any flames with the fire blanket. If fire spreads call 999. In case of burns follow actions for burns above.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (Medium) 

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Petroleum Jelly

**Description**: Allergy to petroleum jelly.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (Medium) 

**Mitigation**: Ensure demonstrator is aware of what materials are used in the experiment and that they will need to touch petroleum jelly. Do not proceed if the demonstrator has an allergy, or has an allergic reaction. Wash jelly off hands after applying it.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2 (Low) 

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Relighting / adding more fuel

**Description**: Fuel can vaporise if added to hot equipment and be dangerous during ignition.

**Affected People**: All (particularly demonstrator)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator should **use enough fuel initially to cover their whole demonstration**. If they're running out of fuel then they should make the most of it whilst it's burning then give the rest of the explanation with it burnt out. Relighting should only occur once the equipment has cooled so that adding new fuel doesn't cause it to bubble/evaporate.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (Medium)
