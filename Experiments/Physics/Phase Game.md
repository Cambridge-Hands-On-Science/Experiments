## Experiment Explanation 

When you have a large number of children to entertain for an unknown period of time, who do you call? Phase busters!

**This game is designed to be run in schools or on jamborees when there are a large number of children who need entertaining**

The principles of the game are simple. You yell a phase, or a phase transition, and the children act in a manner akin to molecules in that phase.

**Basic calls:** 
Solid: The children stand still, with their hands by their sides. Some huddling may be encouraged, but isn't necessary.
Liquid: The children walk slowly, I generally also bring my hands up, palms together, wiggling in front of me to worm around. They should probably come close together too.
Gas: Walking (or running if they seem trustworthy) as far apart as possible, bouncing off the edges of the container.
Melt: Transition solid to liquid
Evaporate: Transition liquid to gas
Condense: Transition gas to liquid
Freeze: Transition liquid to solid
Sublimate: Transition solid to gas
Deposit: Transition gas to solid

**Other call options:**
Oxygen or Nitrogen: Children are a gas in pairs (holding hands with a partner)
Ozone: Children are a gas in 3s (have some demonstrators there to make up to a multiple of 3 if necessary)
Neon: Children are a monatomic gas, as per the previous gas description
Benzene: Children are in rings of 6
etc. (make up as you like)

**Spiel:**
To start with I introduce that we're stood in a beaker (or something similar) and that the children are the molecules. Maybe some discussion here of what molecules/atoms are; don't need to go too complicated. See if they know what the molecules do in a solid, liquid and gas. Then start making some calls and get them to do the appropriate actions. This is a good time to gauge how well the group is behaving and point out that those misbehaving/pushing/running everywhere may have to go stand with a teacher. Use solid to stop them for more instructions.
More Q&A. How do we get between phases (or states, or types, whatever they can handle)? If you hold ice in your hand what happens? What's that called? Try a few out, remember you can still call solid to get them all to stop. I'd only stick with what they're likely to have heard of at this stage.
Trickier now, sublimate and deposit are added. See if anyone knows the word, maybe get them all to say it back. Examples include dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), pieces of ice in cold dry conditions, formation of snow and frost.

**Variant**:
Knock out game (maybe once they're getting tired, or from the start because you're bored of running the other one. Don't make it knock out for a bit so that they get the hang of it and all get a chance to do something. Use the alternative calls, sometimes people won't have a full group. These people (or the last group formed) are out. They can cheer on their compatriots as they play on or be gradually siphoned off to home time etc. For example:
14 children in room, call "Benzene", two rings of 6 form, other children out.
12 children in room, call "Ozone", last ozone to form is out.
9 children in room, call "Nitrogen", lonely child out.
8 children in room, "Benzene" again, 2 spare children out.
6 children in room, "Ozone" again, last ozone formed is out.
3 children in room, call "Neon", they all look confused as no one is out.
3 children in room, call "Nitrogen", lonely kid is out, other 2 children are winners.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Children running around

**Description**: Falling over or banging into each other.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Children should be asked be careful and to be aware of falling over risk. The speed of the game should be limited to a safe one (get them to walk instead of run if they are behaving dangerously). Over-excited children should be asked to stand out for a round or two. Make sure that the floor isn't slippery before starting (wet hall floor, leaves outside, wet grass etc.Call first aider in event of injury. Stop experiment if required.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Static objects/other children

**Description**: Collisions/tripping over objects leading to injuries.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Clear away or keep the game away from any static objects likely to cause danger. Use area markers which are not dangerous to run into. As for falling over risk, limit the excitement of the game as required and make the children aware of the risk. Call a first aider in the event of an emergency.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
