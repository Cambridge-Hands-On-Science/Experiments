# Scale of the Solar System

**By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you might be surprised how far that actually is!** - By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you might be surprised how far that actually is!

c=6ms-1

For 2m (roughly demonstrator height) Sun:
Earth marble
Jupiter ball
c=1ms-1 (GUESS!?!)

Sun marble
Earth 2m away
Jupiter 10m
Neptune 60m

Sun 1mm (pin prick hole in card)
Neptune 4m
Alpha Centauri 29km

Solar System (sun to neptune) 1mm
Alpha Centauri 10m

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Balls/marbles

**Description**: Tripping or falling over stray rolling balls/marbles.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator must emphasise that children must walk, should stop everyone walking to actually do explanations. Take note of any trip hazards (cables, other experiments, etc.) that may block the path of children walking & warn them to be careful of these if necessary.
Must be made very clear to children that they may not kick or throw the balls ever.
Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Small parts (marbles)

**Description**: Small balls used in some parts of the experiment being swallowed with potential of choking.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Do not use small balls parts of experiment for audiences of very young children.
Keep track of all small parts.  Don't lose your marbles!
Call a first aider in the event of swallowing/choking

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5
