## Equipment Needed 
- Lemonade Bottle
- Matches

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

A smoking (recently blown-out) match is dropped into a lemonade bottle containing a little water. The bottle is closed and then squeezed, held for a few moments, and released. This step may need to be repeated a few times. When you release the bottle clouds should nucleate on the nuclei provided by the smoke particles.

By squeezing the bottle you increase the pressure inside it and also the temperature. This causes the liquid inside to evaporate and form water vapor. Then, when the bottle is released, the pressure decreases again and the temperature drops. This fall in temperature allows the water molecules in the bottle to condense around the smoke particles, forming a cloud.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Matches

**Description**: Possibility of burns from lit matches.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Only demonstrator to use matches; ensure that matchbox is not available to be grabbed by children.
Demonstrator to strike and extinguish matches away from self but also to take care not to strike immediately towards visitors.
When dropping match into bottle, avoid having hand directly above match.
Ensure match is no longer lit when dropped into bottle. (There should be visible smoke)
Have a cup (or similar, not flammable) of water to hand to take matches which might be lit and not used.
In case of burning, run burns under tepid water for at least 10 minutes, and contact a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Lit matches (dropping)

**Description**: If lit match is dropped on something flammable there is a risk of fire.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15 (Very High) 

**Mitigation**: Keep flammable materials away from experiment. Avoid blowing on the match to extinguish it. Have a fire extinguisher available. Fight fire if safe to do so - can also use the cup of water if it is a small fire.

If fire gets out of control evacuate area and call 999.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (Medium)

### **Hazard**: Water

**Description**: Slip hazard in the event of spillages.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Have paper towels handy and dry any spills immediately.

Contact a first aider in the event of an accident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Smoke

**Description**: The amount of smoke over a long period of time may irritate the throat and eyes. It could also trigger asthma attacks.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12 (High) 

**Mitigation**: Make sure demonstrator has access to water. Wear a face mask and safety goggle if possible. If they start to get irritated they should request to take a break and get some fresh air or request to swap experiment if they prefer. Demonstrators with asthma should be discouraged from demonstrating this experiment.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (Medium)
