## Equipment Needed

- Two large interleaved books attached to ropes

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation

<!-- Here are some example headings to follow, but feel free to ignore these and / or make your own! -->

### Have people try to pull them apart in a tug-of-war fashion. It's basuically impossible as there is a huge surface area of contact between the books.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Uneven/cluttered space

**Description**: Falling over.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Only perform in a clear/soft area free from trip hazards. Use sensible volunteers of reasonably even strength so one can't pull the other over.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Book breaking

**Description**: Falling over.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Check condition of both books before use. Only allow 1 vs 1 to limit forces.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Books

**Description**: Papercuts

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Encourage people just to handle the strings, not the books themselves. Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Rope

**Description**: Rope burn

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Inspect strings before use. Don't wrap strings around limbs

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
