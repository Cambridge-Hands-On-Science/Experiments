## Experiment explanation

Batteries have a lot of their own terminology (cathodes, electrolyte, voltage etc.). Be conscious of how much your audience knows and don't introduce too many new words. It's fine to use simple words like "juice" for electrolyte or "metals" for electrodes. 

If you haven't used a multimeter before, here is a guide: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-use-a-multimeter/

**Coin battery**
<br/>
In 1780, a doctor called Luigi Galvani was dissecting a frog when he noticed that the frog’s legs twitched when contacted by two different surgical instruments made from different metals. This *sparked* a debate as to whether the electricity came from the frog or from the metal instruments. A scientist called Alessandro Volta proved that it was caused by the metals when he made his “voltaic pile”, one of the first batteries. We are going to replicate his experiment with our coin battery. (Volta’s cell differed slightly from this by using zinc and copper as the electrodes, and sulfuric acid and brine as the electrolyte). 

1.	Tear a square of aluminium foil just larger than a coin. 
2.	Tear a similar sized piece of paper towel and dip it in the vinegar. 
3.	Place the towel on top of the foil, then add a coin cell on top. 
4.	Measure the voltage of the cell using the voltmeter (should be around 0.5V). 
5.	If you stack enough cells, you can power an LED by connecting the legs of the LED to the ends of the stack. This requires up to 8 cells.
Note that it’s easier to measure the voltage of the stack if the foil at the bottom is a long strip that sticks out from the bottom of the cell.

Troubleshooting:
-	Check no foil is touching other cells and short circuiting the battery. 
-	LEDs only work one way, so try swapping it around. 
-	Make sure there is good contact between the layers by squashing it down. 

**How does it work?**
Batteries are a form of energy storage. The aluminium and copper are called *electrodes*. When they are connected via the vinegar (the *electrolyte*), a chemical reaction occurs on both surfaces. The reaction on the aluminium (the *anode*, or *negative electrode*) produces electrons, and the reaction on the copper (the *cathode*, or *positive electrode*), uses them. When ends of the cell are connected via a wire (i.e. the LED), the electrons can flow through the wire from the aluminium to the copper, generating electricity. 

**In more detail**: Aluminium is more reactive than copper so is oxidised (loses electrons) to produce aluminium ions:
Al --> Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3e<sup>-</sup>

The electrons flow through the wire and are used in a reduction reaction (gain of electrons) on the copper surface:
2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> H<sub>2</sub>

Full cell reaction: 2Al + 6H<sup>+</sup> --> 2Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3H<sub>2</sub>

H<sub>2</sub> bubbles away as gas. Importantly, no electrons move through the electrolyte - only through the wire. H<sup>+</sup> ions move through the electrolyte to balance the charge of the electrons. Acidic solutions are a source of H<sup>+</sup> ions, which is why we use vinegar, which contains acetic acid. 

Aluminium wants to give away its electrons more that copper does. This creates a kind of pressure, pushing the electrons from aluminium to copper when they are connect by the wire. This pressure is called the *voltage*. 

When we connect the batteries in series (i.e. stack them), the voltages of each cell are summed together to give the total stack voltage. 

**Fruit batteries**
<br/>
This is the same idea as the coin battery, but we’re now focusing on the electrolyte – the juice in the middle of the battery. The anode has swapped from aluminium to zinc, but we still have copper as the cathode. 

1.	Using the LED connected to a copper and zinc rod, stick the copper rod into one lemon and the zinc rod into another. 
2.	Connect the two lemons using another copper and zinc rod, connected by a wire.
3.	The LED should light up. If not, you may need to add more lemons to the circle. 

Try different fruits/vegetables to see which work best. 

**How does it work?** 
We now have zinc as the anode: Zn --> Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

The new full cell reaction is: Zn + 2H<sup>+</sup> --> Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

In this experiment, we're experimenting with different types of electrolyte. The main criteria is that the electrolyte must contain H<sup>+</sup> ions (i.e. be acidic), as these balance the charge of the electrons, and are needed in the reduction reaction on the cathode. 

Lemons work well because they are acidic - they have lots of citric acid in. You could relate this to lemons tasting sour, which is due to their acidity. Potatoes also work as they have some phosphoric acid in, but they are less acidic than lemons so have a lower voltage (produce less electricity) - you should be able to show this using a multimeter.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Sharp plates/nails/forks

**Description**: Could hurt people/cause cuts - also a risk of infection.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Monitor kids when they are using metals (and take over yourself if kids are not old enough to handle safely), and make sure metals are not too sharp. Clean metals before use to remove any surface bacteria.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Fruit juice/vinegar

**Description**: Irritation if it gets in eyes.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Encourage metal rods to be put carefully into fruit to prevent squirting of fruit juice.
Call a first aider if fruit juice/vinegar gets in eyes, who may perform an eyewash if trained and confident to do so.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Fruit juice/vinegar

**Description**: Juice is acidic and can cause damage if in contact with cuts.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 3

**Mitigation**: Check that children don’t have uncovered cuts before starting demonstration. 
Clean rods between use so not covered in juice when children handling them.
Demonstrators should wear plasters over any cuts they have (there are also disposable gloves in safety if preferred).
In case of accident, wash the affected area with clean water.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Fruit juice/vinegar

**Description**: Kids might be tempted to try to ingest the juice, thinking it might be food.

**Affected People**: Public (mainly children)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Don't let the children consume anything or lick their fingers.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Electric shock

**Description**: Stacking more than 10 cells could give a small electric shock. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 3

**Mitigation**: Don't stack 10 cells or more. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

*(Fun fact: Volta tested how powerful his stacks were by giving himself electric shocks)*

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Coins

**Description**: Choking on coins. 

**Affected People**: Small children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Watch small children carefully. In the event of a piece being swallowed, encourage child to cough. Call a first aider, who may perform the Heimlich if trained and happy to do so.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5
