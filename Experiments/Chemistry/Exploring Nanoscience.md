## Experiment Explanation

### In a nutshell.....
This experiment explores how nanoscience differs to science on a "normal" scale by demonstrating the effects of nanomaterials. 

### Tiny teacup
Fill both teacups with water, then let the children attempt to pour them out. The water shouldn't leave the tiny teacup. This is demonstrating two competing forces: gravity and surface tension. Gravity is more important on a larger scale, whereas surface tension is more important on a small scale. The point of this experiment is to show why nanoscience is its own area of science - different forces and mechanisms become important on a nanoscale. 

### Sand
There are three types of sand: normal, kinetic and hydrophobic. Let the children play with sands and notice their different properties. 

Kinetic sand is covered in a thin polymer layer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), which makes the sand stick to itself. The polymer layer is too small to be noticeable to us, but it has a big effect on the properties of the sand. 

Hydrophobic sand is coated with a silicon compound that is one nanometer thick. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter - your fingers grow one nanometer per second! Like the kinetic sand, this tiny change makes a big difference. 

You can pour water on the hydrophobic sand to show how it repels water, but avoid getting water in the kinetic sand as it will change its properties. 

### Battery and bulb circuit
Draw two lines next to each other with the graphite pencil. Tape the legs of the LED so that one leg is attached to each line. Place the battery over the opposite ends of the lines. The LED should light up (I will put in a photo of this to make this clearer - JT). 

Note that LEDs only work in one direction so you make need to turn the battery around. 

Graphite is made of many layers of carbon atoms and conducts electricity, so completes the circuit between the battery and the bulb. 

You could also talk about how we can take a single layer of graphite, called graphene. This was first discovered by using ordinary tape to strip apart layers of graphite. Graphene is a nanomaterial.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Small parts (tiny teacup, LED)

**Description**: Choking on small parts. 

**Affected People**: Small children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Watch small children carefully. In the event of a piece being swallowed, encourage child to cough. Call a first aider, who may perform the Heimlich if trained and happy to do so.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

### **Hazard**: Sand

**Description**: Getting sand in eyes. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Discourage children from throwing sand. Ask them to wipe their hands after playing with the sand. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Water

**Description**: Slipping in split water. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Take care when pouring water than it doesn't go on the floor. Clean up any spills immediately. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
