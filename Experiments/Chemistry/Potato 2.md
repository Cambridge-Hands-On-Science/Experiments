## Experiment Explanation 
### In a nutshell.....
Iodine turns blue black in contact with starch. This doesn't happen in the presence of vitamin C so vitamin C solution can be used as invisible ink on regular, starchy paper. Iodine will reveal the message/painting. 


### How to set up the experiment
Put down a tablecloth and wear gloves, set up bottles of iodine and small beakers of vitamin C solution with paintbrushes in them. Put a selection of food in two small bowls (the same selection in each) and add iodine solution to one bowl. The starchy foods should turn blue/black. 

**Important:** Only you should handle iodine, do not let the participants handle iodine (even if they ask nicely) as it stains the skin and is harmful. 

### Demonstrating the experiment

#### What does iodine do?
•	Show them the samples of food. Show them a set without iodine solution and the set with iodine solution. 
•	Show them that some foods cause the iodine to turn blue/black because they are full of starches,  whilst others do not because they contain very little (or no) starch.

#### Vitamin C Invisible ink
•	Tell the participant to write their name on the back of the paper.

•	Tell the participant to draw anything they like on the paper using the paintbrushes and the vitamin C solution. This will work best when the layer of vitamin C solution is quite thin (because it will dry quicker and not spread around as much).

•	Wait for the vitamin C to dry slightly.

•	Brush on a thin layer of the iodine solution. The paper should turn blue-black whilst the parks with vitamin C should remain white. Try to do just one layer!

•	Hang the drawing up on a peg and ask the participant to come back later if they want the drawing. This might be tricky based on how busy CBS is so make an assessment on whether you will keep saying this or not.

•	You can take the paper off the peg and leave it for people to collect once it has dried.


### Simple explanation 
Some foods are full of a type of molecule called starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Think of things like potatoes and pasta and rice, they are all made of starch. 

Iodine solution is a common test for these starch molecules. On its own, it’s a yellow colour, but when it comes into contact with starch it becomes blue-black. You can see which foods contain starch because they are stained blue, whereas other foods are yellow because they contain less (or no) starch.

We also use starch to make our paper stronger and smoother. It’s a small amount, but it’s enough to make the iodine go blue-black. 

The vitamin C reacts with the iodine to and prevents it from going dark. In fact, it also turns it from yellow to colourless! This is why the parts of the paper with the vitamin C remains white


### Less simple explanation 
Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are made of repeating units of simpler carbohydrates (like glucose) and they form long chains. In our bodies, starches are broken down into simple sugars so that we can use them in respiration to give us energy. 

One of the starches in our food (and in the paper) is called amylose, which has a helical structure. When iodine solution comes into contact with it, the triiodide anion (three iodine atoms joined together with and overall negative charge) embeds itself within the helix on the amylose. This complex turns a blue-black colour, much different to the yellow of the iodine solution. 
Vitamin C is acting as a reducing agent, which turns the triiodide anion into regular iodide ions (just one iodine atom with a negative charge), which is colourless. This is why the parts of the paper that has the vitamin C remains white, as neither the yellow nor blue-black iodine colour can form in the presence of Vit. C.

One use of the iodine test is to determine the ripeness of fruits such as apples. As fruits ripen, their starches are converted to sugars, which makes them sweeter. Farmers can take sample fruits and use iodine to determine the level of starch within them, which is inversely proportional to the level of sugar. This means that they can determine more objectively how ripe their fruits are.  

### Questions to ask 
•	What food groups can you think of. Do you know any molecules that might be prevalent within those groups?

•	Do you think we can test for these molecules?

•	What is starch?

•	Why do you think some foods here are blue and others aren’t? Can you see any similarities between them?

## Risk Assessment

Likelihood and severity scores are out of five and overall score is out of twenty-five. 

### **Hazard**: Iodine

**Description**: Iodine is a toxic chemical. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 4, Overall: 16 (high)

**Mitigation**: See COSHH assessment below. Iodine must only be used at low concentrations (0.01M), which makes it not very harmful, but it can stain skin. Explain to the participants that iodine is harmful and they should not touch anything except what they are directed to touch (paintbrushes with vitamin C, dry paper). Demonstrator to wear gloves. No one but the demonstrator should touch the paper until it is dried. Great care should be taken to not flick the paintbrush when removing it from the bottle. If iodine gets on the skin, wash immediately with plenty of water. If it gets in the eyes it should be washed out by a parent/first aider with plenty of water. If swallowed, the person should drink water (at most two glasses) and be advised to see a doctor if they feel unwell. In case of spills, evacuate area and wipe up immediately. Iodine cannot be poured down the sink and must be taken to a chemistry lab for disposal.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (moderate)

**COSHH**

**Hazards**: Toxic to humans and aquatic life

**Approx. Quantity and Physical Form**: 1L of 0.01M solution

**Risk Phrases**: H302 (harmful if swallowed), H332 (harmful if inhaled), H312 (harmful in contact with skin), H315 (causes skin irritation), H319 (causes serious eye irritation), H335 (may cause respiratory irritation), H372 (causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure if swallowed), H400 (very toxic to aquatic life). 

**Exposure Routes**: Ingestion, inhalation, absorption

**PPE**: Gloves

**Waste Disposal**: Aqueous (hazardous)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Glassware

**Description**: Broken glassware can cause cuts. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (moderate)

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator to ensure glassware remains on the table and away from the edges. If glassware breaks, the area should be closed until it is cleared away. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (moderate)

<br/>
 
### **Hazard**: Retort stands

**Description**: Retort stands are heavy and could injure someone if they fall from the table. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (moderate)

**Mitigation**: Keep the retort stands away from the edges of the table. Demonstrator to ensure children don't knock the retort stands. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (moderate)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Food

**Description**: The food may be contaminated with iodine or other things from the venue so must not be consumed. 

**Affected people**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8 (moderate)

**Mitigation**: Advise the participants not to eat the food. Keep out of reach of children when not in use. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4 (low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Vitamin C 

**Description**: Vitamin C is an irritant. Consuming large quantities can cause gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, cramps, nausea). 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (moderate)

**Mitigation**: Vitamin C should not be handled by the participants. The solution will be diluted down to <0.1M. Any vitamin C solution on the skin or eyes should be rinsed. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (low)
