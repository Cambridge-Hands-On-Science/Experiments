## Experiment Explanation 
### In a nutshell.....
Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide

Production of carbon dioxide in a sealed container to produce explosions.

### How to set up the experiment
Set up the clear plastic box in a large tray, with the lid opening towards you. 

**Important:** Stick some gaffer tape along the hinge line facing the audience to prevent lemon juice escaping through the crack. Fill one of the smaller Tupperware containers with water to use for washing out film canisters.

### Demonstrating the experiment
Initially, mix lemon juice (about 1/8 fill the canister) and bicarb (1/4 of a teaspoon) in the film canister with the lid off, so that the kids can see it frothing up. If the kids seem responsible, you can add the bicarb and let a volunteer add a squirt of lemon juice. Ask them where they think the bubbles are coming from/what's in the bubbles (space for a bit of a discussion of different gases here, many of them will have heard of CO₂). 

Get them to think about what lemon juice is like (sour therefore an acid), and what else is sour (vinegar, other citrus juice...) and discuss that any acid can let out the gas that's "trapped" in the powder. Possibly also discuss use of bicarb in baking - heating it up releases gas, which puts bubbles in your cakes.

The bubbles should froth well over the top of the canister. Ask them to predict what will happen if you put a lid on (does the gas have anywhere else to go?)

Now try it and see if they're right! With older kids you can discuss how molecules create pressure, ask them to push their hands against each other a bit to demonstrate reaction forces. 

Some children ask why there is no 'fire' if it is an explosion. It can be worth explaining that an explosion is simply a rapid expansion of gases and release of stored energy, often with heat being produced, though this is not a necessary condition. Sealing the canister causes the pressure to build up, which stores energy, until the lid can no longer resist the force of the trapped gases. The stored energy is then released rapidly when the lid pops off and gases expand, causing the explosion.

There are 2 slightly different approaches:

#### Method 1 (easier and effective)
Fill the canister about 1/6 of the way with lemon juice (or let a responsible volunteer do it), press bicarb into the well in the centre of the lid. Invert the lid and make sure the bicarb stays stuck in there. Inside the plastic box, with the lid partly shut, gently put the lid on the canister; the bicarb is now held at the top of the canister away from the lemon juice.

Invert the canister, place it on the bottom of the box, and shut the lid fully (it's often a good idea to have the lid partially shut before you invert the canister to reduce the risk of it getting on you). The bicarb and lemon juice will mix, pressure builds, and the pot will explode upwards. The less lemon juice there is, the more time you have before the explosion but the explosion is no less vigorous (assuming the seal is good), since the film canister will always pop at the same pressure and a slower reaction will build up pressure more slowly. You could ask older children to work this fact out for themselves.

#### Method 2
Put some lemon juice in the canister, put a piece of tissue paper over the top of the canister with bicarb on top of that, push the lid on so it hold the tissue paper. The bicarb is now held at the top of the pot away from the lemon juice.
Put the canister upside down in the clear plastic tank and shut the lid (it's often a good idea to have the lid partially shut before you invert the canister to reduce the risk of it getting off you). The bicarb and lemon juice will mix and the pot will explode upwards.

It's usually a good idea to try both methods before the kids arrive and see which one works better for you and the type of film canister you happen to have.

**Some film canisters explode better than others, so it is worth trying different ones to make sure you are using the right lid. The translucent white plastic ones work really well.** Ask a committee member or experienced demonstrator.

### Other things to think about
Vinegar (acetic acid) is a stronger acid than lemon juice (citric acid); if using vinegar expect this reaction to be quite quick... (can talk about why stronger acids cause a faster reaction). You could also link the experiment to a rocket launch – the canister shoots upwards because the gas pressure pushes the CO₂ and liquid out of the bottom, generating an upwards reaction force. Rockets work in the same way by forcing gas out of the back at great speed (though this is normally powered by combustion rather than an acid-base reaction).

### Packing away
Give everything a wash, ideally with hot, soapy water. Dry the box (by leaving it out or using paper towels). Put everything (except the big tray) back in the big blue box – to make everything fit you will probably need to put smaller components (e.g. the tub of film canisters) inside the clear plastic box.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Liquids

**Description**: Spillages pose a slip hazard.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Clear up spills as soon as possible if on a slippery floor. Do experiment outside if possible. Do experiment in tray to avoid spilled liquid going on floor. Put wet floor sign down if needed.

Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Explosions

**Description**: Explosions could get out of box, (or occur before the canister has been put in the box) and get into eyes, or box could jolt and hit children if they are too close.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 4, Overall: 16

**Mitigation**: Do experiment in a clear lidded fish tank so kids are not peering over the top to see what is happening and tell them to stay a good distance back, keep lid opening faced towards demonstrator. It is important to keep the kids under control. Try to keep control over at least one of the reagents, so the kids can't just do it themselves.

Ensure the top of the tank is not at eye level (it is common for a small volume of the reagents to be propelled through the crack between the top of the tank and the lid). **Run a length of plastic tape along the hinged side (which should be closest to your audience) to prevent splattering.**

Only assemble the cannisters when in the box and the lid is partially closed. Tissue paper may be used as a "fuse" to increase the time taken for the reactants to come into contact with each other - this gives more time to get the canister into the tank. Lemon juice is usually better than vinegar, as it reacts more slowly, so again, there is more time to get the canister into the tank. In addition, eye protection should be provided for demonstrators to minimise possible risk of solution splashing into demonstrator's eyes.

Eyewash should be kept on hand when demonstrating (but put back in Safety for storage between demonstrating days). If solution or reactants have entered eyes, call first aider, who will use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and confident to do so.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Reactants

**Description**: Some people might be allergic to lemon juice or bicarbonate of soda.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Put up a sign warning of potential allergens in the reagents. If participant(s) are allergic, they should stand well back and not touch anything. Do not leave kids alone with the experiment.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Reactants

**Description**: The reaction mixture could be eaten by a child and cause a stomach upset.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: The lemon juice and bicarbonate of soda are food-safe, but they still should not be eaten as they might be out of date and will not have been refrigerated.

Do not let the kids do the reactions themselves or leave them alone with the experiment.

It is important to keep the kids under control. Try to keep control over both reagents. Warn children not to eat/put hands in mouth.

In the event of eating, advise them to seek medical attention if they start to feel ill.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
