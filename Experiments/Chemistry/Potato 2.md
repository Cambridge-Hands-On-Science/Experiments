## Experiment Explanation 
### In a nutshell.....
&&Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide

&& Production of carbon dioxide in a sealed container to produce explosions.

### How to set up the experiment
Put down a tablecloth and wear gloves, set up bottles of iodine and small beakers of vitamin C solution with paintbrushes in them. 

**Important:** Only you should handle iodine, do not let the participants handle iodine (even if they ask nicely) as it stains the skin.

### Demonstrating the experiment

#### What does iodine do?
•	Show them the samples of food. Show them a set without iodine solution and the set with iodine solution. 
•	Show them that some foods cause the iodine to turn blue black because they are full of starches,  whilst others do not because they contain very little (or no) starch.


#### Vitamin C Invisible ink
•	Tell the participant to write their name on the back of the paper.
•	Tell the participant to draw anything they like on the paper using the paintbrushes and the vitamin C solution. This will work best when the layer is quite thin (because it will dry quicker and not spread around as much).
•	Wait for the vitamin C to dry slightly.
•	Brush on a thin layer of the iodine solution. The paper should turn blue-black whilst the parks with vitamin C should remain white. Try to do just one layer!
•	Hang the drawing up on a peg and ask the participant to come back later if they want the drawing, this might be tricky based on how busy CBS is so make an assessment on whether you will keep saying this or not.
•	You can take the paper off the peg and leave it for people to collect once it has dried.


### Simple explanation 
Some foods are full of a type of molecule called starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Think of things like potatoes and pasta and rice, they are all made of starch. 

Iodine solution is a common test for these starch molecules. On its own, it’s a yellow colour, but when it comes into contact with starch it becomes blue-black. You can see which foods contain starch because they are stained blue, whereas other foods are yellow because they contain less (or no) starch.

We also use starch to make our paper stronger and smoother. It’s a small amount, but it’s enough to make the iodine go blue-black. 

The vitamin C reacts with the iodine to and prevents it from going dark. In fact, it also turns it from yellow to colourless! This is why the parts of the paper with the vitamin C remains white


### Less simple explanation 
Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are made of repeating units of simpler carbohydrates (like glucose) and they form long chains. In our bodies, starches are broken down into simple sugars so that we can use them in respiration to give us energy. 
One of the starches in our food (and in the paper) is called amylose, which has a helical structure. When iodine solution comes into contact with it, the triiodide anion (three iodine atoms joined together with and overall negative charge) embeds itself within the helix on the amylose. This complex turns a blue-black colour, much different to the yellow of the iodine solution. 
Vitamin C is acting as a reducing agent, which turns the triiodide anion into regular iodide ions (just one iodine atom with a negative charge), which is colourless. This is why the parts of the paper that has the vitamin C remains white, as neither the yellow nor blue-black iodine colour can form in the presence of Vit. C.
One use of the iodine test is to determine the ripeness of fruits such as apples. As fruits ripen, their starches are converted to sugars, which makes them sweeter. Farmers can take sample fruits and use iodine to determine the level of starch within them, which is inversely proportional to the level of sugar. This means that they can determine more objectively how ripe their fruits are.  

### Questions to ask 
•	What food groups can you think of. Do you know any molecules that might be prevalent within those groups?
•	Do you think we can test for these molecules?
•	What is starch?
•	Why do you think some foo here are blue and others aren’t? Can you see any similarities between them?

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Iodine

**Description**: Very dilute iodine, as used in this experiment, is not classified as hazardous but it can stain hands and clothes. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Only small volumes of iodine will be used and this will only be done by the demonstrator. Care should be taken to not flick the paintbrush with iodine on. Participants should only handle the paper once it has dried. Iodine on skin should be washed off immediately in the toilets. If iodine gets in eyes, will require flushing area with water by a first aider. 


**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Vitamin C 

**Description**: Not an allergen but an irritant. 

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Vitamin C will be diluted down <0.1M. Any vitamin C solution on the skin or eyes should be rinsed. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
