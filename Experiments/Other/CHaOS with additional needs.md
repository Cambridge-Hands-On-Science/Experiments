## Equipment Needed 
- **This experiment can take place outdoors**
- You'll need to pick another experiment in conjunction with this (and sign it's RA). Depending on the needs it's hard to say an experiment but the following recommendations work well for most:
- Cornflour
- Mini Explosions
- Animal Cognition
- Arch Bridge
- Cantilever Bridge
- Spinny Chair
- (Any experiment that has lots of touch, feel elements and less talking explanation)

## Experiment Explanation 

Firstly you should talk to the teacher/parents before starting to check exactly what the requirements of the group are. The teachers and parents will probably make these needs known to you and ask several questions about what they think will work well. This is probably best done by the floater who can relay their needs and information in here which is relevant. The floater should pay special attention to these groups and move them around to demonstrators prepared to take them with suitable experiments. There may be several needs within a group which may make things more complicated. You may be able to discuss this in the venue briefing if you have enough time and notice or at a break time.

**Speech:**
They should be able to say if you'll be restricted to simple English, can use a translator or even if they're deaf and you can't use words. The group may have a mixture in which case make sure you're sufficient for the lowest ability but you can add in simple words for everyone else's benefit.
The main keys are lots of doing and touching. You might have to complete the actions and gesture for them to copy you. 
You'll also want to think about what words are key to the experiment, with limited English momentum may not be productive to mention as they won't understand what it means. 
Also experiments which play off hearing can be very interesting for hearing impaired, for instance if someone is deaf in only one ear then ear switching hat will be a very interesting experience. 

**Sight:**
This one is fairly hard however try and make experiments fairly tactile or feeling based. You may have some issue guiding them to complete tasks however hopefully they have someone to help them reach and touch things or get on to the spinning chair if they're very limited in size.

**Wheelchair:**
Fairly simple to deal with, make sure there's enough space for them to travel around. 

**SEND**: Aim for sensory experiments that the children can enjoy without needing to understand the science. Some experiments that might work:
- A Bug's Life
- Animal Skulls
- Cuddly Microbes
- Sheep Skeleton
- Cornflour
- Mini Explosions
- Arch Bridge
- Cantilever Bridge (both bridges depend on mobility - if the children are in wheelchairs they're not going to work)
- Rocks and Fossils
- Boris
- Air Streams
- Fire Tornado
- Hot Air Balloons
- Spinny Chair (again depends on mobility)
- Water Rockets
