## Equipment Needed

Mains (240 V) power supply.

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation

Some experiments require electricity from a mains power (240 V) supply. Read this RA along with the experiment RA before demonstrating.

## Risk Assessment


### **Hazard**: Faulty/loose wiring and equipment

**Description**: Risk of fire or electrocution. This risk applies only to mains voltage equipment that plugs into the 240V mains supply; any part of an experiment that comes into direct contact with the public will use a power supply with a safe low voltage output.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: DEMONSTRATOR must visually inspect all electrical equipment before using it. Please look for loose cables, bare wires or anything else suspicious. If you spot faults then please do not use that equipment, and report it to a committee member.

DEMONSTRATOR to ensure that there is a PA test sticker dated within the last two years on any mains voltage equipment, or that the equipment was purchased within the last two years (should be marked with the date of purchase if there is not a PA test sticker). If the equipment was PA tested or purchased more than a year ago, DEMONSTRATOR to check that there is a sticker to show that the equipment has been formally visually inspected within the last year.

DEMONSTRATOR to ensure that electrical equipment is not placed next to or under flammable materials (eg. under a jumper).

COMMITTEE to ensure that all mains voltage equipment is PA tested every two years, or if possible, annually. Newly purchased (unaltered) equipment need not be tested immediately, but should be tested, at the latest, within two years of purchase, and then every two years thereafter. If newly purchased equipment is not marked with a PA test sticker, it should be marked with the date of purchase. Electrical equipment that has been modified in any way should be PA tested before first use

COMMITTEE to ensure that, if equipment has not been PA tested within the past year, it is formally visually inspected by a committee member approved by the committee to carry out such checks, and marked with the date of inspection</p>
			

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Water getting in contact with the equipment

**Description**: Risk of electrocution

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: DEMONSTRATOR must think about the danger of water coming into contact with the equipment. Ensure electrical equipment is not near water, or on the ground in a place where water might pour in event of a nearby experiment breaking.
If outdoors, DEMONSTRATOR to keep cables off ground and away from damp, especially if using the venue the next day as well (dew settles).

DEMONSTRATOR please make sure that you know the location of the electric wall socket where the equipment is plugged in.

VENUE SAFETY OFFICER should locate and make known the location of the cut-off switch for the room, if there is one.
			

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Trip hazard on cables

**Description**: Risk of injury or pulling things over

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 5, Severity: 2, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Ensure all cables are safely taped down, take extra care in areas where people might be walking. If possible, keep cables behind experiments.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6
