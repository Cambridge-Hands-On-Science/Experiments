## Equipment Needed

An outside area

## Experiment Explanation

Some experiments can be demonstrated outside. Read this RA along with the experiment RA before demonstrating outside.

## Risk Assessment


### **Hazard**: Hard and potentially uneven floor

**Description**: Risk of potentially enhanced injury if person falls over whilst engaging with experiment.

**Affected People**: All, particularly children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Ensure the experiment is set up on flat floor, away from potential trip hazards (e.g. steps) or drops (e.g. gutters). If experiment involves lots of motion (e.g. spinny chair), take extra care while supervising visitors, and do not leave the experiment unattended. If the experiment is to be held and carried around (e.g. floating experiments such as prism goggles) then demonstrator should ensure that the experiment is being done safely, avoiding e.g. accidentally walking into a gutter.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Weather (Part I)

**Description**: Rain and/or ice could make the outside floor slippery. Wind could blow objects into people or push visitors off of relevant apparatus.

**Affected People**: All 

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: >In the event of adverse weather, encourage children to behave sensibly and not run about. If the demonstrator or committee deem the weather to make the experiment too dangerous to operate, close the experiment (e.g. too windy or wet).

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Weather (Part II)

**Description**: Cold / hot weather causing adverse effects to visitors or demonstrators

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Demonstrators should be dressed appropriately for the weather. If hot, demonstrators should seek water from committee members. If cold, demonstrators should have sufficient layers. If very uncomfortable, demonstrators should be moved inside. Visitors should also be monitored, and offered e.g. water if severely affected by the weather.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Crowds

**Description**: There may be a queue of people nearby, and people walking in and out of the area, posing a risk of being bumped into / invading experiment spaces.

**Affected People**: All (mainly visitors)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8 

**Mitigation**: Experiments should be set up far enough away from each other such that there is minimal risk of visitors engaged in separate experiments from taking up required space from another experiment. Experiments should be set up away from the queues, and the way in/out of the building(s). If the experiment is to be held and carried around (e.g. floating experiments such as prism goggles) then demonstrator should be aware of their surroundings at all times, and ensure visitors do not accidentally hit other people potentially walking by.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
