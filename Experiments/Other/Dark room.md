## Equipment Needed

Dark sheets to cover windows etc.

## Experiment Explanation

Some experiments are best performed in a dark room, read this RA in along with the experiment RA before demonstrating.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Fire

**Description**: Dark room fabric may catch fire.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10 

**Mitigation**: We have tested fabric for flammability.Keep all electrics away from fabric, and off the floor if there is a risk of moisture getting into the electrics. Keep fire extinguisher in dark room. Check carefully behind tent for heaters etc. In the unlikely event of a fire, the tent walls can be lifted/detached quickly to allow exit.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Heat exhaustion

**Description**: The darkroom can get hot - may cause heat exhaustion

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8 

**Mitigation**: All demonstrators to have water bottles. Ensure demonstrators change round regularly and floaters visit the dark room to check everything&#39;s okay. Use fans and make sure the chimneys are providing ventilation.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 8 

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Unseen drop

**Description**: If a stage or other raised area is used as a darkroom, curtain may mask drop

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Do not use a darkroom in significantly raised areas. Most "darkroom" experiments still work in well-lit rooms. Where possible leave a gap between a drop and the edge of the dark room. Clearly mark sides next to drops (e.g. hazard tape along inside). If possible site experiments to block access to drops.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Child abuse

**Description**: Risk of child abuse, or child abuse allegations, if demonstrator alone with children in darkroom.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Ensure a minimum of two demonstrators are present at all times. If this is not possible, close the darkroom.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4
