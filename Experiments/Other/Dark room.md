## Equipment Needed

Dark sheets to cover windows etc.

## Experiment Explanation

Some experiments are best performed in a dark room, read this RA in along with the experiment RA before demonstrating.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Fire

**Description**: Dark room fabric may catch fire.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10 (High)

**Mitigation**: We have tested fabric for flammability. Keep all electrical equipment away from fabric, and off the floor if there is a risk of moisture getting into the equipment. Keep fire extinguisher in dark room. Check carefully behind tent for heaters etc. In the unlikely event of a fire, the tent walls can be lifted/detached quickly to allow exit.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Heat exhaustion

**Description**: The darkroom can get hot - may cause heat exhaustion

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6 (Medium)

**Mitigation**: All demonstrators to have water bottles. Ensure demonstrators change round regularly and floaters visit the dark room to check everything is okay. Use fans and make sure the chimneys are providing ventilation.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Unseen drop

**Description**: If a stage or other raised area is used as a darkroom, curtain may mask drop

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (High)

**Mitigation**: Do not use a darkroom in significantly raised areas. Most "darkroom" experiments still work in well-lit rooms. Where possible leave a gap between a drop and the edge of the dark room. Clearly mark sides next to drops (e.g. hazard tape along inside). If possible site experiments to block access to drops.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3 (Low)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Child abuse

**Description**: Risk of child abuse, or child abuse allegations, if demonstrator alone with children in darkroom.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10 (High)

**Mitigation**: Ensure a minimum of two demonstrators are present at all times. If this is not possible, close the darkroom.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5 (Medium)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Falling from height during setup

**Description**: During dark room setup, it will be necessary for committee members to stand om benches or chairs to tape up the dark room walls. They might accidentally fall down and injure themselves.

**Affected People**: Committee members responsible for setting up dark room

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9 (High)

**Mitigation**: Have another person watch the person doing setup, getting ready to catch/support them in case they fall down

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6 (Medium)
