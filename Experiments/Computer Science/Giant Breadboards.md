## Equipment Needed

- **Batteries needed**
- Boards with pins to attach components to
- Selection of clip-in components (in clear plastic bags):
  - Battery boxes
  - Wires
  - Switches
  - Resistors
  - Capacitors
  - Diodes
  - Light bulbs and LEDs
  - Motors
  - Inductors
  - Light sensors, microphones, etc.
  - Various ICs (the big square boxes)
- Fans to attach to motor
- Spare fuses, batteries, etc.
- Instruction manual with example circuits
- Ready-made kits containing similar components to above

- Old/WIP stuff (currently unusued), leave in the box while demonstrating
  - Giant breadboard
  - (Selection of wooden components)
  - (Material samples)
  - 4mm banana plug wires
  - Spare banana plugs and components.
  - Many spare electrical components (mostly through hole-useful for fixing other electrical experiments)

## Experiment Explanation

The experiment (and this explanation) is still in the process of being finished; it currently consists of a whole bunch of electronic components to make circuits and demonstrate various properties of electricity.

The experiments with clip-on components are ready to use (and safest as there are no wires with pointy edges).

Particular recommendations for circuits to make and demonstrate (from the Hot Wires book) would be:

- Experiment 2: Powering the motor and fan (**using only one battery pack**) - the fan will take off when you switch the current off, so be prepared for that! Make sure people stand well back!
- Experiment 5: Simple LED circuit - make sure to include a ≥ 100 Ω resistor in series with LEDs
- Experiments 7 and 8: LEDs in series and parallel
- Experiment 11: Variable brightness LED (only use one battery pack!)
- Experiment 12: Charging a capacitor (PLUS)
- Experiment 14: Dark sensitive LED (PLUS)

The experiments marked with PLUS have more complex explanations and are more suited to an older audience.

Feel free to try other things with the clip-in components, but I wouldn't touch the other parts with loose wires as they are unfinished, and some have sharp points which can cause injury

## Packing Away

Remove batteries from battery box and store in separate bag. Separate components and return to *correct* bags, loosely sorted into wires, bulbs, switches, resistors, etc.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Quickly spinning / flying fan in Experiment 5

**Description**: Getting fingers trapped in blades or being hit by the flying fan, leading to injury

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Tell people to stand well back before powering the fan, and only use one battery pack to limit the speed and the height it reaches.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Batteries

**Description**: Potential for battery corrosion, releasing acids that can irritate skin and cause eye damage.

**Affected People**: All, particularly demonstrators

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Remove batteries from the battery boxes when not in use.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Using excessive voltage or current.

**Description**: This could cause components to get damaged and have to be replaced. In the worst case, an overvolted capacitor could explode causing injury, although this is very unlikely with the small capacitors and voltages used.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Only use one battery pack at a time wherever possible. Preferentially use the grey battery packs with the built-in 500 mA fuses. Always install a 100 Ω current-limiting resistor in series with any LED.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Small/sharp pieces in old set of unused components.

**Description**: Choking hazard, potential for minor cuts on sharp edges.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Do not use this equipment out until it has been made into something more complete. Leave it in the bag.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Electric current.

**Description**: Electric shocks

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Only use 1.5V AA batteries, not power supplies and definitely not mains power! Where possible, use only one battery pack and preferentially use the ones that have integrated 500 mA fuses.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2
