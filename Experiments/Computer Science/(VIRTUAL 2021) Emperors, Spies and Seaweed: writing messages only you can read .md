## Equipment Needed 
- **Darkroom needed**
- **Electricity needed**
- Lemon Juice
- Malt vinegar
- Washing Powder/fluorescent ink
- Suncream/antifluorescent ink
- Writing implement: cocktail sticks, fountain pen or paint brush
- Fire/heat: bunsen burner, lighter or hot steam from kettle
- Red Cabbage Juice
- UV light
- Foam scytale (cylinder)
- Paper scytale messages
- White worklights
- Water in transparent containers
- Dyes*3
- Padlocked box

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Invisible ink:
Lemon juice + heat
Malt vinegar + Red Cabbage Juice
Fluorescent/Antifluorescent ink + UV light

Scytales:
Can be enough for each audience member. Wrap paper message around appropriate scytale (they have different diameters) to reveal message

Padlocked Box:
Box locked by padlocks. To send message, Alice attaches her padlock and sends to Bob, who attaches his padlock and returns to Alice. Alice detaches her padlock and sends back to Bob, who takes off his padlock.

Key Exchange Demo:
Shine worklights through dyed water in darkened theatre to reveal colour. Alice and Bob have their own unique colour. There is one universal colour that all can access.
Alice and Bob perform tasks symmetrically: They both mix their own colour with the universal colour, send the result to the other and mix that with their own colour, resulting in both having the same colour; keys have been exchanged.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Lemon juice/bicarb/washing powder/vinegar

**Description**: Lemon juice/vinegar and bicarbonate of soda irritant to eyes.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ensure that users only use small amounts if they try this themselves. Do not squirt bottles, particularly in the direction of passers by. 
Ensure that if in contact with eyes, wash with emergency eye wash provided if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider if necessary.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Lemon juice/vinegar/bicarb

**Description**: Eating/drinking bicarbonate, lemon juice or vinegar.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 3

**Mitigation**: Make it clear that they need to be carefully supervised by adults.
If ingested, advise parents that reactants are all edible, but to seek medical attention if child is feeling unwell as reactants may have been in box for unknown amount of time.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Washing Powder and sun cream

**Description**: Eating washing powder or sun cream.

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Make it clear that they need to be carefully supervised by adults.
If ingested, advise parents toi seek medical attention.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Cocktail sticks/writing implements

**Description**: Splinters/stabbing

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ensure that adults check for obvious splinters on cocktail sticks to be used. Adult supervision should prevent silly behaviour which may lead to stabbing. Do the same when demoing

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Padlocked box

**Description**: Box could fall and cause injury if heavy.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Use a light box. Ensure demonstrator is large enough to carry it.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Box and padlocks

**Description**: Trapped fingers

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Lock box sensibly.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Work lights

**Description**: Dazzling

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Advise audience beforehand in case of conditions such as epilepsy. Cover sections of lights not being used.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: UV

**Description**: Skin/eye damage.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Use soft UV - the UV light was on sale to the general public so the wavelength is at the safer end of the UV spectrum. Point light away from self. Avoid prolonged skin exposure.
In the event of an accident, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Water near work lights

**Description**: Electric shock

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Only speakers to perform demo. Use as small quantities of water as necessary to observe effect. Use non slip containers. If spill occurs turn off at mains. In event of emergency call first aider (and turn off power if safe to do so). See electrical parts RA

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Inappropriate images on google search

**Description**: Kids/adults see inappropriate content.

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Check that content for search does not result in inappropriate images before talk - check with safe search off.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
