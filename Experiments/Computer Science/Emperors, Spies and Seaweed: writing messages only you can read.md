## Experiment Explanation 

Invisible ink:
Lemon juice + heat
Malt vinegar + Red Cabbage Juice
Fluorescent/Antifluorescent ink + UV light

Scytales:
Can be enough for each audience member. Wrap paper message around appropriate scytale (they have different diameters) to reveal message

Padlocked Box:
Box locked by padlocks. To send message, Alice attaches her padlock and sends to Bob, who attaches his padlock and returns to Alice. Alice detaches her padlock and sends back to Bob, who takes off his padlock.

Key Exchange Demo:
Shine worklights through dyed water in darkened theatre to reveal colour. Alice and Bob have their own unique colour. There is one universal colour that all can access.
Alice and Bob perform tasks symmetrically: They both mix their own colour with the universal colour, send the result to the other and mix that with their own colour, resulting in both having the same colour; keys have been exchanged.

## Risk Assessment

('Lemon juice/bicarb/washing powder/vinegar', 'Lemon juice/vinegar and bicarbonate of soda irritant to eyes.', 2, 3, 6, 'Only use small amounts. Do not squirt bottles, particularly in the direction of the audience/volunteer. \r\nIf in contact with eyes, wash with emergency eye wash provided if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider if necessary.', 1, 3, 3)

('Water near work lights', 'Electric shock', 2, 4, 8, 'Only speakers to perform demo. Use as small quantities of water as necessary to observe effect. Use non slip containers.
