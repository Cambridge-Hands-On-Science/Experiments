## Equipment Needed 
- Paint Brushes
- Paper
- Light bulb or other source of heat
- Lemon Juice
- Bicarbonate of soda
- Fruit Juice

## Experiment Explanation 

Use two methods of invisible ink. 

Lemon juice method. 
Use a paint brush to write on the paper in lemon juice, allow this to dry, then hold it up to the light (heat source). It should brown in the places where the writing was. 

How does it work?
The lemon juice is acidic. This means that it attacks the paper, so the parts it is on are thinner and burn more quickly. 

Backing soda method 
1. Mix the water (1/4 cup) and baking soda (3 tablespoons) in a cup with a teaspoon. 
2. Get them to dip a paintbrush in the solution and write a secret message, thinly. Then wait for it to dry. 
3. Brush some blackcurrant/grape juice across the sheet and the message should appear. 

How does it work? 
Baking soda is alkaline. Blackcurrant/grape juice is acidic. When you put these juice concentrates on top of baking soda, a chemical reaction takes place which produces a colour change in the paper. 

Other things to talk about: cryptography.

## Risk Assessment

('RISKS', '1)\tSlip hazard if anything is spilt. \r\n2)\tAny of the juices are irritant to eyes and cuts. \r\n3)\tLight bulb gets hot.')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS', '1)\tUse small amounts of liquid in a large container, keep liquids in secure location away from electrical equipment. \r\n2)\tUse paintbrush for writing on paper, donâ€™t squirt any of the liquids.\r\n3)\tEnsure no one touches the bulb.')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT', '1)\tClear up any spillage straight away. Call first aider in case of injury.\r\n2)\tCall first aider in event of incident. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and confident to do so.\r\n3)\tIn case of burn, call first aider, encourage them to run burnt area under cold tap.')
