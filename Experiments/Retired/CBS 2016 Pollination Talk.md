## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- Several pairs of fluffy gloves, Large number of velcro balls (hooked side), 6 large, straight-sided plastic jars
- Fan, Large quantity of hole punchings, Sticky sticks, Plastic sheeting
- Straws of assorted sizes, flexible plastic tubing, bottles of 'nectar'

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

We will add our talk as it's written...

<br/>

## Risk Assessment

('Description', 'Children with different length straws but same bottle, showing how some pollinators are adapted to certain flower shapes', 'Have child put on glove coated in velcro and reach into jar to get sweets, get coated in soft "pollen" (velcro balls)', 'Using a fan to blow small paper circles ("pollen") onto sticky surfaces (flowers)')

<br/>

('Hazard', 'Bottles of liquid  Straws cut to different lengths', 'Glove may be scratchy  Jars of sweets', 'Small bits of paper on floor could be slippery  Sticky flowers')

<br/>

('Risks to audience', 'Could splash/be dropped  Children may have allergies to sugary drink  Straws could have sharp ends', 'Being scratched  Getting hand stuck in jar  Allergy to contents', 'Could slip while leaving lecture theatre  Might leave other surfaces sticky')

<br/>

('Risks to presenter', 'Could get liquid spilt on electrical equipment  Could splash/be dropped  Straws could have sharp ends', 'None', 'Could slip while finishing lecture  Might stick to prop')

<br/>

('Control measures', 'Ensure children are in an area away from wires/electrical equipment when drinking/holding the bottles of drinks  Have paper towel on hand to tidy any spills  Choose plain drink with no artifical colourings/flavourings to avoid allergies  Check when cutting to leave smooth ends, discard potentially dangerous ones', "Ensure velcro doesn't go quite to edge of glove so no scratching when putting on  Make sure jar could easily fit adult hand (aids with setup too), warn volunteers of contents, choose sweets least likely to trigger allergies (avoid artificial colourings)", 'Ensure paper blown into corner away from exit route. Lay out large sheet under area blowing paper to speed up tidying up and avoid paper everywhere  Use double sided tape, not glue, so stickyness cannot come off onto other surfaces so easily. Find a lid to cover with until needed.')
