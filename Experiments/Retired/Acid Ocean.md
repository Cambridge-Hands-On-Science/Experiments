## Equipment Needed 
- Disposable cups
- Disposable straws
- Water
- Universal Indicator
- Shells/ limestone
- Weak acid (need to see if vinegar/ lemon juice are sufficient)

## Experiment Explanation 

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION] 

Overall: what actually happens to the oceans when CO2 increases in the atmosphere. This means more CO2 dissolves into the oceans as well

 **Basic demo** 

Fill cups with water/ universal indicator.

Discuss respiration briefly; we breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2

Participants blow into cups through straws; the CO2 this emits will make the liquid change colour, indicating acidification. 

Talk about what they think making the ocean more acidic will do to the creatures that live there. Say that shells/ some rocks are make of limestone.

Test what happens to shells/ limestone when acid is dropped on them (they fizz and dissolve, like a tooth in coca cola).

 **Older students** 
Talk about the ocean as a buffer - can absorb lots of CO2 (e.g. by dissolving carbonate deposits), keeps it out of the atmosphere, but does change conditions for the creatures that live in the ocean.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Small parts (shells)

**Description**: Choking hazard/ possible sharp edges

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Remove broken shells/ shells with sharp edges. Keep small parts away from very young children. If choking occurs call a first aider and perform the Heimlich manoeuvre if trained and confident to do so. Encourage child to cough

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Acid

**Description**: Burn skin

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Use very diluted acid/ lemon juice or vinegar if possible. Store in dropper bottle so not much acid can possibly come into contact with skin. Keep close eye on participants

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Straws and cups

**Description**: Disease transmission between participants

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Change straws and cups between participants

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
