## Experiment Explanation 

(D\_ indicates a demonstration)

It’s your best friend’s birthday! Yay! But unfortunately he lives on the other side of the world and you have forgotten to send him his birthday card! Oh no! What’s the quickest way we can transport this birthday card to the other side of the world?
Run? Usain Bolt top speed, 30 mph, would take 35 days! (D1, Run across room)
Racing car? F1 car top speed, 2500 mph, would take 4 days. (D2, Drive RC car across bench)
Helicopter? Top speed, 300 mph, would take 3.5 days. (D3, Fly RC helicopter across room)
Aeroplane? Top speed, 2000 mph, would take 12 hours. (D4, Throw paper aeroplane across room)
Or we could send him an email or speak to him on Skype which would get the message to him almost immediately! But how fast can we send information to the other side of the world and back and how do we send this information so fast?
Using light! 
Just like when we use Morse code we can encode a message into a series of on and off flashes of light (D5, Laser beam in smoke machine, flash it on and off). 
But what’s the biggest problem in using light to send information around the world? Light travels in straight lines (D5, Laser beam in smoke machine, hold it on) but the earth is a sphere. (D6, Shine torch on sphere, light doesn't go through!). So how can we bend light around the earth? One way to change the direction of light is by using reflection. Just like when we look into a mirror. But it’s not just mirrors that can reflect light. In fact, when light travels through water into air it can be completely reflected back. The surface of the water acts like a mirror (D7, Shine laser into tank of milky water at a shallow angle, see total internal reflection of light at surface of water).
What’s great about this type of reflection is that it applies to any situation where you have water in air, for example for a stream of water (D8, Shine laser into stream of water coming out of a plastic bottle into a bucket, light visible in bucket).
Great thing is that it doesn't just work for water, it works whenever you are travelling at a large angle from something more dense into something less dense. For example through a plastic rod into the air (D9, Shine laser through straight plastic rod and bent plastic rod). 
So this is how we can send our Morse code in light around the earth (D9, Shine laser through bent plastic rod while flashing it on and on). We call these optic fibres. Now you may already have these optic fibres in your home, if you have one of these optic fibre lamps (D10, Optic fibre lamp).
Now you can see from this lamp that all sorts of different colours of light can be sent through an optic fibre, so how do we decide which colour of light is best? And where do we get the light from? Where does light come from? The sun, light bulb, laser. Most common source of indoor lighting is a light bulb, so can we use a light bulb to send information down our optic fibre? 
Problem with light bulb is that it is made up of several different colours of light. We know this because the light from a light bulb looks white, and when we combine the light from a red, green and blue lamp (three primary colours of light) we get white light (D11, Shine light from red, green and blue lamps onto wall). You can also see this effect when you spin a cardboard disk of the colours of the rainbow very fast (D12, Spin cardboard disk with colours of rainbow on a piece of string very fast). 
We can also see that white light is made up of the colours of the rainbow by splitting the colours up using a prism (D13, Shine Maglite light through prism onto white cardboard).
The problem is that it not just prisms that separate out the light into its different colours, this also happens in the optic fibre. So one flash of light gets separated as it travels down the fibre and it takes much longer to receive the message, it delays the message (D14, Bunting, starting with all flags overlapping, while walking from one side of the room to the other, separate out the flags until they are fully separated). Another problem is that the different colours of light are emitted at random directions from the light bulb so it is difficult to get many into the optic fibre (D15, Throw different coloured balls into the air at random, very few will go into the optic fibre).
So how can we overcome this problem? Use a single colour of light. How do we generate a single colour of light? Using a laser. Great thing about laser is that it is a single colour, so it doesn't separate as it travels through the fibre, so the message is not delayed (D14, Bunting, with a single flag walk from one side of the room to the other). Also the light is not emitted at random but in a particular direction so it is easy to get most of the light into the optic fibre (D15, Throw one colour of ball into the air in a particular direction, all will go into the optic fibre). 
Great, so now we clearly have light going into the fibre, but how fast can we send a message around the world and back? In order to work this out we need to calculate the speed of light.
Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, waves going from gamma rays to radio waves (have slide with radiation symbol, medical x-ray image, visible light, a microwave, a radio alongside waves of increasing wavelength), they all travel at the same speed, so if we find the speed of one, we find the speed of all. 
When a microwave is switched on microwaves are generated inside and they form a pattern like this (have slide with animation of standing waves in a microwave). Where there are peaks in the wave, they cook food faster, and where there aren't, the food is cooked slower. This is why microwaves have a spinning bottom, to spread out the heat. But if we remove the spinning plate and put in a large chocolate bar, we should see the chocolate bar melts faster where there are peaks in the wave and slower where there aren't (D16, put chocolate bars on a large plate in microwave for a few seconds, measure the distance between melted patches with a ruler). This tells us the distance between the peaks in the wave. Using this and the frequency written on the back of the microwave (slide with picture of back of microwave) you can calculate the speed of light using this formula, speed of light = frequency x wavelength.
Therefore, speed of light is 3e8 ms-1 and that’s how we can get around the world and back in 0.1344 seconds!
