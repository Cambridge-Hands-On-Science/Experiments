## Equipment Needed 
- 700-1000g of jelly
- 10l of water
- Cotton Wool
- A blue box as a jelly mould
- A Sharp Knife to cut the Jelly
- Corrigated card (or even better plastic)
- Gaffer Tape
- 
- OPTIONAL Criticool maybe used with power to cool jelly while not in use

## Experiment Explanation 

**Making the jelly**

Mix up the jelly (it should be 6-10x the normal strength - I found this easiest in a saucepan, in a sink full of hot water so it doesn't cool down too fast.) pour it into the box and add cotton wool in smallish puffed out lumps and try and distribute it throughout the jelly. Leave overnight to set.

Make a mould and if we have corrigated plastic - integrating it into the mould would be a really good idea.

**Making the plates (do this before the visitors are present)**

Cut the lump of jelly in two. Stow knife away somewhere safe. Then get some corrugated card and strip the paper off one side, so the corrugations are visable. cover the back with something waterproof like gaffer tape (or the card will go soggy), then attach this onto the faces of the fault... 

The two lumps of jelly should be placed on pieces of card to stop them sticking to the table

**Making earthquakes.**

Push the two lumps of jelly past each other slowly and it should stick and slip making the jelly wobble - forming earthquakes.

**Other things to talk about.**

Drag fingernails across a blackboard/ steel across steel/ bow across violin strings - all cases of slip stop frictionas well as squeaking beaks and may others

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Jelly

**Description**: Ingestion of jelly by children, which has been sitting out in the warm (possibly culturing bacteria).

**Affected People**: Children

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Keep jelly in fridge as long as possible, and don't let the kids eat it.
If ingested, warn the parents that there are some germs in what their child has just eaten, and to see a GP in the unlikely event of the child having symptoms of food-poisoning or tummy upset.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Knife

**Description**: Possible cuts when cutting jelly.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Knife is only required for setup stage so put away during the experiment to prevent children having access.
Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Dropped jelly

**Description**: Slip hazard

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Donâ€™t let children play with jelly off the table. Clear up any dropped jelly immediately.
Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2
