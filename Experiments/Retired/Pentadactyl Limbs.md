## Equipment Needed 
- Selection of animal forelimbs - borrowed from Zoology (rabbit, dog, mouse, sheep, turkey)
- Set of laminated limb-shapes and bone formations
- Pictures of animals

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Matching up laminated shapes of animal limbs to laminated bone outlines and real bones themselves. Talking about common ancestry. 

The same basic 5:2:1 bone structure is found in many different animal forelimbs ranging from human forearms, horses, bats, dolphins, rabbits and turkeys. 

More details to follow.

(Only able to borrow the forelimbs for CBS)

## Risk Assessment

('Bone tips', 'Some bones may have sharp tips â€“ cuts.', 'Likelihood score', 'Severity score', 'Overall', 'Remind children to handle bones carefully; in particular, warn not to stab each other with small bones.\r\nIn case of injury, call first aider.', 'Likelihood again', 'Severity again', 'New overall (hopefully better than the first)')

<br/>

('Bones', 'If dropped, bones may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other injuries.', 'Likelihood score', 'Severity score', 'Overall', 'Demonstrator only have a few bones present at a time to minimise risk of children picking up or playing/messing with the bones. Demonstrator to keep an eye on anybody holding bones. If a bone smashes, clear it up immediately with dustpan and brush. Any bones with sharp edges may need to be smoothed off or replaced.\r\nWarn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut him/herself on the bones. Advise parents to take child to a doctor if the cut looks infected.', 'Likelihood again', 'Severity again', 'New overall (hopefully better than the first)')

<br/>

('Bones', 'Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone.', 'Likelihood score', 'Severity score', 'Overall', 'These bone specimens have been borrowed from the Zoology Department and are safe for handling. Please note, however, this does not necessarily mean that the bones are completely sterile now. Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut him/herself on the bones; Advise parents to take child to a doctor if the cut looks infected.', 'Likelihood again', 'Severity again', 'New overall (hopefully better than the first)')

<br/>

('Laminated sheets', "Possible 'papercuts' from laminated shapes.", 'Likelihood score', 'Severity score', 'Overall', 'Smooth off the corners on the laminate shapes, and be aware of children waving the shapes around, warning them not to.\r\nIn case of injury call first aider.', 'Likelihood again', 'Severity again', 'New overall (hopefully better than the first)')
