## Experiment Explanation 

NB: This experiment is included as an historical reference, and is unlikely to be resurrected in the form described here due to it's excessive malodorous substance content. 

Different functional groups have different characteristic smells, e.g. esters smell sweet and fruity, amines smell of rotting meat. We have a range of smelly chemicals and try to get the kids to group them according to smell and hence functional group. We also have models of all the chemicals so try to get the kids to group these according to shape (of functional group) and then make the connection between shape and smell.

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS', '1. Only very small amount (one drop) of chemical used \r\n\r\nPermeable membrane lid on bottle ensures only very small amount of chemical released\r\n  \r\nLids taped on to bottles so that they cannot easily be removed\r\n\r\nBottles are distinctive and look like they come from a laboratory, so noticeably should not be carried off by child\r\n\r\nBottles clearly labelled with orange hazard labels (flammable, harmful, corrosive) and numbered so that demonstrator is immediately aware if one is missing\r\n  \r\nDemonstrator keeps control of all bottles at all time: Do not allow any of them out of your sight, do not allow public to remove lids\r\n\r\n If necessary (e.g. particularly busy event) bottles attached to table (or other heavy difficult to move oject) via string so that they cannot be physically removed\r\n  \r\nExperiment carried out in well ventillated area \r\n\r\n2. Chemicals contained in sturdy glass bottles which should not break when\r\ndropped etc\r\n\r\n3. When preparing experiment (pipetting chemicals into bottles) wear gloves\r\nand eye protection and perform in very well ventilated area, ideally fume\r\nhood, but otherwise outside. Pipettes and contaminated gloves should be\r\nleft in well ventilated area until smell has subsided and then disposed of\r\nappropriately.\r\n\r\n4.

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT', 'If bottle breaks: evacuate area if neccessary because of smell, clear up broken glass and remove to well ventilated area e.g. outside until smell has subsided then dispose of appropriately.\r\n\r\nIn case of chemical contact with eyes, rinse immediately with eye wash if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider and seek medical advice.\r\n\r\nIn case of accident or if you feel unwell seek medical advice immediately.\r\n\r\nIf chemical swallowed seek medical advice immediately and show container/label.')
