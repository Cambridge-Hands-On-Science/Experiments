## Equipment Needed 
- Salt ice bath (use a box if in need of a container)
- Lemonade bottles

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Cool down lemonade to about -5Â°C in an ice salt bath and then open the lid. As you do so the lemonade will freeze. 

When the lid is opened, pressure inside the bottle is released. CO2 which is dissolved in the lemonade forms bubbles which are released into the air. This decreases the number of solutes (molecules dissolved) in the lemonade, increasing its melting point. The bubbles can also act as nucleation points for the ice, so the lemonade freezes. These bubbles are what make lemonade 'taste' fizzy.

Dissolved CO2 lowers the melting/freezing temperature of lemonade in the same way that putting salt in water lowers its melting point. This is why we put salt on roads in winter to stop them getting icy.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Spills

**Description**: Slip hazard if you drop the ice water mix on the floor

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Clean up spill immediately. Call a first aider in the event if injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Cold

**Description**: The lemonade bottles may be cold as they're frozen.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 1, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: People should drop them as an instinctive body response. Warn people not to touch frozen bottles. Call a first aider in case of accident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Explosions

**Description**: Bottle exploding if it froze hard, and had lots dissolved gases in it and it was damaged

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Don't let sealed bottles freeze hard. Check bottle has no obvious damage before beginning the demonstration.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4
