# Are you smarter than a computer?

**Artificial Intelligence** - What does it mean to be intelligent? Can computers be intelligent? Are they more intelligent than us?
Explore some of the questions in AI, meet a few different AIs and compete and befriend them and find out the maths of how they work.

## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- This talk will require Â£150 exactly of kit.

## Experiment Explanation 

We're going to investigate several topics in AI. There's a talk with it which is still TBC but here's the brief summary of some demos which I may or may not use. I'll RA some of them separately as they're intended as standalone experiments. 

Electric Shock Learning - I will touch an 'electric shock generator' and then talk about learning. I haven't decided if this will be an actual Van Der Graff or I'll just test out my acting skills.

Draw Something - I'll get some people to do some drawing and compete with an AI to guess what it is. This maybe done on a tablet budget dependant.

Turing Test - We'll get the audience to use the voting devices to out the AI. Some volunteers will be able to come down and ask questions.

Rock Paper Scissors Glove - A willing volunteer will play rock paper scissors against an AI. They wear the magic glove which has several sensors on it and links via cable to an Arduino and servo. cf Rock Paper Scissors Glove

Turing Machines - we could play with this very basic model computer or binary adder or maybe not. cf mechanical calculation.

LEGO Suduko - http://tiltedtwister.com/sudokudownload.html very cool use of AI
