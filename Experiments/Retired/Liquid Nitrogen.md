## Experiment Explanation 

Doing various experiments using liquid nitrogen including:
# Showing it in double walled pint glasses
# Smashing flowers
# Smashing rubber gloves
# Shrinking baloons
# Blowing the lids off tins
# Creating huge quantities of foam

First READ THE RISK ASSESMENT!! This experiment can only be done in venues where we have access to a suitable local supply of liquid nitrogen (e.g. the Cavendish teaching labs)

Liquid nitrogen is great as a teaching aid, and I like to get lots of bits of science in while people are interested in the subject

There is more stuff than you need here, pick what to talk about depending on how with it the audience is.

**What is Liquid Nitrogen**

This is cold - go through temperature line down to nitrogen. For example, -71 deg. C was the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth. Possibly mention absolute zero

Pour some nitrogen into a double thin plastic pint glass

# What is nitrogen - 80% of air
# This is what happens when you cool nitrogen down to -196Â°C
# Why is it bubbling? - like water in a 400&degC oven

**Smashing things**
Flower:

What is a flower made of mostly? - water

What will happen to it? - freeze

Smash the flower, you can give out the ex-frozen petals

 Notice the petals are all floppy, and smell really strongly

 This is because the ice crystals break the cell walls apart

 -imagine a cell as a polythene bag of water and gunk

 - what happens to water when it freezes? The crytals are also sharp

**Rubber glove**

Rubber is made of long string like molecules that straighten out when you strech it by each string wriggling past the others.

When you cool it down the the molecules stop wriggling, and the only way it can deform is by breaking

When it warms up it goes back to normal

**Shrinking Balloons**

Use long thin balloons as they fit in buckets better. Start off with a helium balloon if you have got it, otherwise fudge with an air one.

Cool it down, it shoudl shrink 30% or so - and stop floating which you can get in

Do you think that warm or cold things have more energy? - is a cooker adding or removing energy to water

Hot -> lots of energy - what do you do when you have lots of energy? - run about

It often helps to run about and bounce off some walls here

Hot ->Molecules moving fast -> push sides hard -> big baloon

Cold->Molecules slow -> push weakly -> small baloon

**Shrink air balloon**

Some of the air will liquefy in end of balloon - do not get it too close to audience as it may explode

**Blowing lids off tins**

Little liquid blows up a whole baloon so what will happen in the tin?

Put nitrogen in tin, bang on lid

Make sure you have a lever to trigger it in case it doesn't go off of it's own accord

Pressure builds up and lid blows off

**Foam**

Only do outside,with a floor that doesn't mind getting slippy

What happens when we put liq. N2 in wasing up water...

Chuck in about 1-200ml

You get a lot of gas produced so a lot of foam, and some of the foam will freeeze if you chuck in enough nitrogen

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Extreme cold

**Description**: Risk of cryogenic burns. Not very dangerous on skin for a short period but can be very dangerous if poured on clothes and collected near skin. Objects exposed to it, particularly metals, are very dangerous.

**Affected People**: All, but particularly demonstrator (anyone close to the liquid Nitrogen)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Volunteers with previous experience of using liquid nitrogen to demonstrate only. Wear insulated gloves whenever possible. If a dewar needs to be filled from a cylinder, make sure this is away from the public. Do not allow audience to put their hands near the nitrogen or to touch cold things. At least one other volunteer to police this.  Do not let audience members sit on the ground.  Follow guidelines above.  Use in small quantities in a very controlled manner. Use one clear plastic pint glass inside another to hold a sample of liquid nitrogen for the audience to see.  This means no-one needs to come close to see the liquid nitrogen. In the case of a cryogenic burn, loosen clothing around the affected area that may be restricting the blood flow.  Flush with tepid (not warm) water.  Call first aider.  Then cover with clean plastic and wrap in warm clothing (do not allow fabric to touch burn).

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

### **Hazard**: Sharp smashed fragments

**Description**: Cuts etc.

**Affected People**: All, particularly demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Smash objects at a safe distance from visitors, without sending fragments flying.  Clear up any fragments made immediately. Demonstrator should wear eye protection.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Flying tin lids

**Description**: Impact with face or similar.

**Affected People**: All, particularly demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Anchor the tin well. Do experiment away from visitors. Demonstrator should wear eye protection.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Large amounts of nitrogen gas

**Description**: If large amounts of nitrogen are released it can displace oxygen, leading to asphyxiation. Symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, nosebleeds and loss of consciousness.

**Affected People**: Everyone in the room

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Do experiment outside or in a large room. Open windows if possible. Use small volumes of liquid nitrogen. If anyone shows symptoms of asphyxia, call a first aider and move them to a source of fresh air. If symptoms are severe, consider evacuating the room.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Transport and storage

**Description**: If liquid nitrogen is not stored and transported safely there is a risk asphyxiation, leaks and explosions. If a dewar of liquid nitrogen is left to stand for a long time, an ice plug can build up in the neck which can potentially cause an explosion.

**Affected People**: All, particularly demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Liquid nitrogen should be obtained in a safe container from a sensible source e.g. gas cylinder from a university department.  Decant small amounts from gas cylinder into suitable cryogenic dewar whilst wearing insulated gloves, far away from public. Dewar should only be transported short distances (e.g. around department) away from public. Do not allow dewar to stand for long periods of time (probably 1 hour+), if any nitrogen is left over pour away onto ground away from any people.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
