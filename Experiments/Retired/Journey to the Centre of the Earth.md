## Risk Assessment

DESCRIPTION:
Sets of medium-sized rock samples with laminated sheets and foam balls.

RISKS:
Possible choke hazard for small children with the smallest pieces
Dropping rocks could cause injury to feet.
Dropping rocks may cause them to shatter, producing fragments and dust
Rocks could be sharp and cause cut injury

ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS:
Ensure that items are not in the reach of small children.
Hold rocks over a table or close to the floor (i.e. when sitting on the floor).
Keep rocks on felt cloth to protect and to prevent dust if breakage occurs.
Make sure rocks have minimal sharp edges.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT:
Contact first aider if injury occurs.
