## Experiment Explanation 

This experiment is in the process of being made but hopefully will be useful for a wide range of circuit based experiments. I've bought the following pieces to make up the components.
Opamps, transistors, capacitors, motors, solar panel, resistors, logic gates, timers, leds, diodes, thermistors, photoresitors, nickel wire heating element. I'd also like a dynamo for other power input but haven't got this yet and some links to electromag experiment. 
Idea is playing with circuits and building things. 
Plus aim could be an adder using logic gates, feedback devices using Opamps, fire alarm using themisotrs, light alarm using photresistors. 
There'll also be places where you can clip in materials to see how conductive they are, I have some bits of wood, perspex, nickel, and bits we can see how conductive they are. 
There's also an arduino nano which I've got and will link up if we wanted some really hardcore stuff to do.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Power from dynamo/battery/power supply

**Description**: Electric shock

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Limit power supply to minimise danger

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Heating element

**Description**: Burns

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Keep power low and prevent children from touching the heating element. If a burn occurs run it under cold water for an appropriate amount of time.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Wooden components

**Description**: Splinters

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Sand it down if splintery.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Capacitors and other components

**Description**: Exploding causing parts to fly around and hit people.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Don't use excessive voltage/current. Check health of components before using.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Candle flame

**Description**: Setting things alight, or setting off fire alarms

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Supervise candle while lit, don't use near flammable things, watch people's hair.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4
