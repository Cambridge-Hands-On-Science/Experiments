# Colour Mixing and Spectra

**Primary coloured LED lamps for experimenting with light colour mixing** - How many colours can you make? With our coloured lights, find out how you can make every colour imaginable from just three colours, find out how your computer monitor works and get to see some really funky shadows!

## Experiment Explanation 

Each LED light pack has multiple settings allowing you to choose to switch on different colours and adjust the brightness settings. More details TBC. The old lamps were no longer working and have been retired.

Suggestions for explanation:

- Mixing a colour – get the children to choose a colour and let them work out how to make it. 
- Demonstrating how the primary and secondary colours (of light) are produced – space the three colours so they slightly overlap to produce three circles of red, green and blue, with cyan, magenta and yellow where two colours overlap and white where all three do
- Fooling the eye – LEDs are fairly monochromatic – their spectrum is not very widely spread about the peak wavelength. Because we expect light to appear as it does from a 6500K light source (the sun), it is possible to confuse the eye when dealing with monochromatic light. For example, mix the lights to produce a white(ish) colour, then put a brightly primary coloured object such as a tomato underneath. Because, the surface will directly reflect a large proportion of one colour, it will appear unexpectedly bright.
- Funky shadows – shine the lamps at a wall or other white surface from some distance away. Observe the multiple shadows of different primary and secondary colours that can be seen. This works best with a wide separation between the lights.

Looking at different light sources using a CD as a diffraction grating. Splitting light with a Lens.

Look at a fluorescent, conventional light bulb, LED etc in a CD to see that they don't have the same spectrum.

Split light (and with any luck recombining it) with a prism

You could also do some reflection and other bits with light using the ray box.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: LED lights

**Description**: LEDs can be intense, possible retinal damage if exposed directly to the eye.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: The majority of LEDs are considered to be class 1 and do not pose a risk to sight ("safe under all conditions of normal use"). The lamps should not, therefore pose a risk to sight even if someone were to look directly into the source. However, please make sure you are using sufficiently low power LEDs, that the brightness is set to a reasonable level and do not allow people to look directly into the beam. Natural aversion should be sufficient in most cases, but demonstrator should keep control of lights and if necessary switch off power.
In the event of a person being dazzled by lights, switch off lights and get them to sit down until they have recovered. Check they are ok before letting them walk around in case they walk into something!

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Sunlight

**Description**: Don't look at the sun's spectra without proper filters.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Use the filters. Tell children why to stop them doing it at home.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Bulbs

**Description**: The LED light packs could crack and potentially leave sharp pieces of plastic.
If being used for comparison, non-LED bulbs could also smash, causing hazardous shards of glass. Also, incandescent bulbs become hot with use.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Pack carefully and check for damage before use. If smashed then sweep the glass or plastic shards away. Don't let people touch/lick to prevent burns.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Prisms

**Description**: May smash

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Keep away from edge of table and sweep mess away promptly if smashed.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
