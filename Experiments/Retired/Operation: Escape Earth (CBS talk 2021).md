## Experiment Explanation 

CBS 2021 - a virtual version of the talk from CBS 2020

A list of the planned demos:
 - Hot air balloon/Chinese lantern - to be flown if possible virtually to demonstrate the limits of buoyancy
 - Hydrogen balloon or helium balloon vs. normal balloon - Compare the two. If a hydrogen-filled balloon is used, burn the hydrogen to show it's flammable
 - Air/alcohol rocket - shoot a bottle filled with alcohol vapour
 - Burning rocket fuel (KNO3 + icing sugar/jelly babies) in an open-topped tank. Alternatively, burning fuel in an open-ended pipe to get directional burning

## Risk Assessment

('Hot Air Balloon/Chinese Lantern', 'Candle', 'Fire risk from candle proximity to paper lantern', 'All', 2, 4, 8, 'Separate candle\tfrom\tlantern, only use candle for\tlift off, get a fire extinguisher for the venue. In the event of a fire, fight the fire if safe to do so or evacuate safely', 1, 4, 4)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Lantern

**Description**: If lantern lands in street/park/whatever venue is used, could cause injury/disruption

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Have a helper on hand to retrieve the lantern once landed

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

('Hydrogen/Helium Balloon', 'Balloon', 'Balloon may burst and surprise people', 'Audience', 1, 2, 2, 'Warn the audience at the beginning of the talk, make sure microphone is not too close and sounds levels are appropriate', 1, 1, 1)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Balloon

**Description**: Balloon may fly into someone if the gas is released (i.e. balloon knot undone)

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Check balloon is securely tied

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Flammable gas

**Description**: Burning hydrogen (if used) presents risk of burns/fire

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Use fuse to light	so it sets on fire	high in the air. Control height with tether, use nonflammable string or wire. Perform outdoors on in appropriate indoor venue. If a burn occurs run it under cold water for at least 10 minutes

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Flash from burning hydrogen

**Description**: Bright flash from burning hydrogen could cause eye damage

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Warn the audience about the bright flash, warn anybody in vacinity of demonstration, demonstrator to not look directly at flash, check camera settings.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

('Air/Alcohol Bottle Rocket', 'Bottle', 'May hit someone', 'Public', 2, 3, 6, 'Use guiding string to control flight path or tether to control range. Stand back. Conduct in empty area. Tie knot in guiding\tstring to stop rocket firing too\tfar.', 1, 3, 3)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Tethered bottle

**Description**: May land on someone when it falls

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Use further tethers to	prevent audience being hit

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Alcohol vapour

**Description**: Fire from burning alcohol vapour could set other things alight

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Use guiding string to control flight path or tether to control range. Stand back. Conduct in empty area, preferably outdoors or large indoor venue. Have fire safety equipment on hand.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Alcohol

**Description**: Could catch fire during refuelling

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Keep	away	from	flame source before lighting

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Rocket

**Description**: Shock due to the rocket

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 1, Overall: 1

**Mitigation**: Warn	audience at beginning of talk, control sound settings

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 1, Overall: 1

<br/>

('Burning rocket fuel underwater', 'Burning fuel', 'If fire cannot be extinguished easily, it could set fire to surroundings', 'All', 2, 4, 8, 'Keep\tseparate from flame sources before lighting and burn on heat plate underwater. Light using fuse. Donâ€™t use much fuel. Have fire extinguisher on hand and do in appropriate outdoors/large indoors venue.', 1, 4, 4)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Directional burning

**Description**: Pipe could be difficult to control, risk of fire/burns

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Secure pipe so that it fires vertically downwards

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4
