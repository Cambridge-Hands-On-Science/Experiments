## Equipment Needed 
- Set of silicon 'beaks' (oven mitts which open with different appetures)
- Beads/balls
- Pots/dishes

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

**Set up and activity**
Place the different sized beads/marbles/string etc. in the pots at different locations on the table.
Offer the group the selection of cutlery 'beaks'.
Either split them into groups each with a different beak and the same 'food' and see who is most successful or let them go around each pot and work out which beak is best for that particular food.

**Explanation**
***Not finished, at all!***Talk about how different organsims are more successful in different environments - natural selection and survival of the fittest. Darwin's finches are a really good example of this. 
---------------------------------------
Sarah suggested using lots of pairs of goggles (like prism goggles) which we could spray paint and scratch, cover with coloured film on the inside and/or drill different sized holes in moving places on. Could get them to complete sight based tasks and see which goggles get selected.
---------------------------------------
Tom&Josh discussed this and think a better way to do this would be using plastic cutlery (very cheap) and having a range of knives, forks, spooons, sporks, chopsticks. All of them with different modifications. You can then simulate food using wool strings and marbles (plastic and heavier ones) of different diameters. You can then simulate evolution with different mixes of food and exposes niches.
For instance having lots of large marbles on top and some woolen strands underneath should be hard for chopsticks, unless there's several individuals who can remove the large marbles quickly and let them come in to grab the noodles.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Beads

**Description**: Choking if beads/marbles are eaten/swallowed.

**Affected People**: Public (children)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Ensure the children don't eat the beads, keep out of reach of small children and set up table away from major walkways.
In case of injury, call first aider. Ask parent to firmly slap back of choking child.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Beads

**Description**: Slip hazard if beads/marbles spill on the floor.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Keep bead pots away from edge of table, discourage boisterous behaviour.
Sweep up beads as soon as they spill, call first aider in case of a fall.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Pots

**Description**: Injury if pots break and form sharp edges.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Discourage boisterous behaviour, and use plastic pots rather than glass.
Clear up broken items promptly. Call first aider in case of injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Silicon oven mitts

**Description**: Allergic reaction to silicon.

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ask if anyone has a silicon allergy before giving oven mitts
In case of reaction, call first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
