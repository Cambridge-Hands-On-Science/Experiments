## Experiment Explanation 

CBS 2019 - Andrew will add explanation later!

In the meantime, a list of the demos in the talk:
1. Burning a methanol-salt mix to show the flame colours of different elements. Presenter to do this.
2. Rolling balls / elastic – two possible ways of showing that we need to put energy in to break things apart, and can get energy back from them coming together. “Ramp” might be a hill made out of a box and some sheets of card that with enough energy (i.e. activation energy) you can roll over. Would likely have child up to help.
3. Flash products – stage magic products that burn rapidly. Paper is sort of tossed in the air and burns out before it could ever land. Presenter would do this. Normal cotton to be burnt for comparison.
4. Sparklers – a child could hold this. Just showing that they can sparkle.
5. Candle – indoor firework to be lit by presenter.
6. Exploding Pringles can – fill a Pringles tube with a hole in the base and side with either hydrogen made from zinc+acid or methane from the gas taps depending on what we can get. The escaping gas is lit from the hole in the base of (inverted) can. Side hole draws O in until stoichiometry happens i.e. BOOM. Can shoot into air. Would be done by presebter.
5. Party poppers – to be given to audience to fire, possibly in groups.
6. Atomic energy levels – kids to pass or gently throw balls to each other to explain ions catching electrons and emitting light.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Flame Test

**Description**: Methanol

**Affected People**: Toxic when ingested or inhaled or in contact with skin

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Use pipette to transfer a small amount only (5-10ml) of methanol to the petri dish to avoid spills. Dispose of pipette according to departmental instructions. Cap bottle when not in use. Perform in well-ventilated space. Burn off excess methanol rather than pouring away. Wash skin or eyes throughly if come into contact. Keep nearby eyewash that can be administered by first aider. Remove contaminated clothing - wear a lab coat to protect this. Demonstrator only to handle. Wear eye protection and gloves. Get medical assistance if necessary.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

('Methanol', 'Extremely flammable - low flash point of 11 C (gives off enough vapour at 11 C for a spark to ignite it). Flame is often nearly colourless.', 4, 4, 16, 'Remove (closed) bottle from area of experiment before lighting. Never add methanol to a burning dish or one that is still hot as may burn back into bottle. Use a borosilicate petri dish (not eg a watch glass as these can tip easily, must be borosilicate). Perform on a heat proof surface with amply spaced dishes. Keep petri dish covers at hand in order to extinguish flame. Remove flammable materials from area as well as anything that might spark. Keep hands away from petri dishes once alight unless confident the flame is out. Any out of control fires should be dealt with in the usual way with a fire blanket or extinguisher or by calling 999. Cover when burnt out to avoid ignition of leftover salts. In case of burns, call first aider.', 2, 4, 8)

<br/>

('Zinc', 'In powdered form may be an irritant to eyes. Explosive if dispersed and may produce harmful zinc oxide fumes.', 3, 3, 9, 'Clean up any zinc spills, remove powder from vicinity of any flame. Wear eye protection. In case of ignition, extinguish fire if possible and remove demonstrator to well ventilated area before seeking medical advice - symptoms may take hours to develop.', 2, 2, 4)

<br/>

('HCl (3M)', 'Irritant, may irritate eyes and respiratory system.', 3, 3, 9, 'Wear gloves and eye protection.

('Natural gas/hydrogen', 'Explosive. Hydrogen flame burns clear and may be hard to see. Risk of burns or hitting by "exploding" container. Not known to cause fires and explosion is well contained.', 4, 4, 16, 'Use natural gas if possible as flame is more clearly visible and avoids need to use the above chemicals to generate hydrogen. Ensure that a good supply of gas is given to the tube with the hole uncovered to ensure that the air is throughly flushed to avoid an instant explosion that might injure the demonstrator and tape over after until used to avoid oxygen contamination. Light with long nosed ligher and do not approach until reaction has concluded as it could explode at any point but may take some time to do so. Can will be propelled a reasonable way into the air so make sure to stand clear. Launch from a heat proof surface. In case of burns, rinse under cold water and seek medical advice if necessary. In case of burn run under cold water & call first aider. In case of out of control fire, deal with in the usual way with a fire blanket or extinguisher or by calling 999 and evacuate if necessary.', 3, 3, 9)

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Point away from other people when pulling. Do not attempt to disassemble or isolate charge - audience should be advised of this. Do not give to small children, preferably hand out to parents to look after until requisite point and have them supervise use.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

('Party Poppers', 'Loud, risk of damage to ears.', 4, 3, 12, 'Do not use near ears and instruct this before anyone uses. To lower the number being fired at once, hand out one per child only, and possibly do it in groups.', 2, 2, 4)

<br/>
