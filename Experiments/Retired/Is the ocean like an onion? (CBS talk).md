## Equipment Needed 
- Large(approx 1x0.5x0.2 m), flat plastic tank (filled with water during experiment)*
- Plain paper
- Salt
- Insulated flasks*
- Ice
- Food colouring (four colours)*
- Plastic cups
- Tube with nozzle and attached funnel*
- Thermometer*
- One(1) raw egg
- Balloons (one semi-inflated, one containing water)
- Tall, clear plastic/glass vase (full of water)
- 
- *borrowed from Department of Earth Sciences

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Prepare waters by dissolving appropriate amounts of salt in warm water. Cool waters to room temperature/0 degC using ice. DO NOT allow water to freeze.
Fill tank with room temperate salty water.
Fill cylindrical vase half with salt-saturated water and then top-up with fresh water, trying to prevent the mare mixing - do this just before the start of the talk.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Ocean mixing tank

**Description**: Large, flat tank of water

**Affected People**: Heavy tank falling over on demonstrators. Large volumes of salt water being spilled.

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Place tank on stable table surface. Don’t move tank during talk. Fill and empty tank in place (rather than moving it while full).

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

('Jet of water coming out of nozzle', 'Demonstrator losing control of the nozzle, and spraying each other.', 3, 1, 3, 'Use clean/fresh tap water for demo. Don’t operate the nozzle while talking to increase concentration. Have drying cloths on hand, and clean up any spills immediately.', 2, 1, 2)

<br/>

('Jet of water coming out of nozzle, in combination with electronics', 'Demonstrator losing control of the nozzle, introducing water into electronics, causing damage to the device, and potential electrocution.', 3, 3, 9, 'Don’t operate the nozzle while talking, to increase concentration. Keep electronics filming/streaming the experiment at greater than a 1m distance from the tank, on a separate table.', 2, 3, 6)

<br/>

('Ice', 'Cold burns from skin coming into contact with ice - especially in association with salty water.', 3, 2, 6, 'Wear gloves when handling very cold water/ice. Don’t put hand into water. Dry hands if they do get wet to prevent further chills.', 2, 2, 4)

<br/>

('Food colouring', 'Spillage - staining the table.', 3, 1, 3, 'Be careful, keep food colouring in the box, wipe up spillages with a cloth immediately.', 2, 1, 2)

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Magic floating egg

**Description**: Egg

**Affected People**: Egg misses the vase of water. Mess, and slipping on eggy floor (demonstrators not allergic).

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Have backup eggs. Clean up any spills immediately.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: What is density?

**Description**: Balloons

**Affected People**: Popping and scaring people. Water spillage in case of water-filled balloon.

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Don't over-inflate/fill balloon. Keep balloon demo away from electronics. Have drying cloths on hand, and clean up any spills immediately.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
