## Equipment Needed 
- Experienced demonstrator (i.e. PhD student who works with ladybirds)
- Various species of ladybird in suitable plastic containers.

## Experiment Explanation 

Looking at different species of ladybird and reflex bleeding.

Run in 2008 by LJ Michie (dept of genetics)

## Risk Assessment

DESCRIPTION
Various species of coccinellid (both adults and larvae) in petri dishes. Children will look at ladybirds and accompanying posters and demonstrator (NOT children) may handle ladybirds to demonstrate reflex bleeding

RISKS
1. Petri dishes may be dropped/broken â€“ risk of injury from broken containers.
2. Petri dishes may be opened and ladybirds released, which could cause panic/excitement in the children and could also result in release of foreign ladybirds in Cambridge.
3. If ladybirds are released and handled roughly, very slight risk of someone being bitten which on even rarer occasions may cause an allergic reaction.
4. When demonstrating reflex bleeding, slight possibility of allergic reaction to reflex blood.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS
1. Ensure that the dishes are kept in close range. Ask children to be careful when handling Petri dishes.
2. Secure the petri dish lids to the petri dishes using tape (stretchy lab tape is fine) so that it is obvious to all that the dishes should not be opened. Keep close watch on all dishes.
3. Children are not to handle ladybirds outside of petri dishes.
4. Demonstrator only to handle ladybirds.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT
1. Wash any small cuts with soapy running water. Compress and elevate large cuts. Ask if victim is allergic to insect bites. Call a first aider.
2. Demonstrator must regain the petri dish and diffuse the situation. 
3. Call a first aider if necessary.
4. Call a first aider if necessary.
