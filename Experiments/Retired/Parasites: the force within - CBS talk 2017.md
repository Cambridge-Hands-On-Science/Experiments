# Parasites: the force within - CBS talk 2017

**This talk will explore the concept of parasitism and give examples of parasites in the wild that live at expenses of other animals or plants as well as explain parasites in human that can be medically important. ** - nan

## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**
- @1
- 	Clear punched pockets, A4, 6-10 of this
- 	Print out images of eggs
- 	Print out images of cuckoo and reed warbler
- 
- @2
- 	A small opaque (or covered) box containing enlarged tapeworm made from plastic sheet or fabric
- 
- @3
- 	2 tupperware, sealed, containing cooked Tagliolini
- 
- @4
- 	Giant slide and coverslip = big aryclic sheet (Check cupboard for one that Lia used before. If need a new one, make 75 cm x 25 cm for slide, and 23 cm x 23 cm for the coverslip)
- 	A soften milk chocolate bar (soften possibly by keeping in a trouser pocket)
- 	Spatula or spreading knife to scoop the “chocolate”
- 	A small bottle of water and large transfer pipette if possible.
- 
- @5
- 	Printed sheet containing list of antibody combination to give to audience (check room capacity, and make ½ of this number)

## Experiment Explanation 

(This talk is previously known as "Parasites: nasty visitors of your body - CBS talk 2016")

Full talk will be put here..once written! For now, the structure will be as followed.

@ indicate audience volunteer and hands-on bit. There will be more interactive moments for audience to respond during the talk too.

What are parasites - a life style, a phenomenon - living on others - and there are many of them living inside or outside bodies here are a very few example.

Parasite in wild - cuckoo birds, toxoplasma
@ Distinguish cuckoo eggs – print off picture of cuckoo eggs and reed warbler eggs individually and ask for volunteers to come out and hold them, ask if audience can tell which one belong to the cuckoo in isolation and then when they are next to the warbler eggs. To find answer, turn around the paper/remove the front page to reveal a picture of baby + play the call of cuckoo or reed warbler (might need assisstant here). 

Parasite in human - toxoplasma (and/or human malaria), schistosoma, tapeworm
 @ Volunteer to pull an enlarged tapeworm out from a box
@ Pass around cooked pasta (Tagliolini) in a sealed tupperware = life-size tapeworms 
 @ Faecal smear with soften milk chocolate bar (Yummm) on a giant slide + identify parasite species from egg shapes

Top tips from the most successful long-live parasites 
- camouflage (e.g. mimicry in cuckoo birds, schistosome)
- calm us down (e.g. lots of worm parasites)
- hide&seek (e.g. malaria, (nurse cells), trypanosome, toxoplasma)
@ Identifying antibody to recognise coating surface of trypanosome – audience will get a sheet containing list of different possible antibody combination (give both colour and letter – think colour-blindness + adult see letters, kids see colours), then I show trypanosome on powerpoint with different coating in the front, ask audience to shout out the matching number as quick as they can.
