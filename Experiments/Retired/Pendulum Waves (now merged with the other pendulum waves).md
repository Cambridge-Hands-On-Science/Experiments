## Equipment Needed 
- The piece of wood with all the washers hanging off of it.
- Another long pole to set it off

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

Different length pendulums swing at different frequencies - see pattern of waves develop as they come in and out of phase with each other.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Pendulum support

**Description**: Pendulum support bar is a large piece of wood and could hurt if dropped on a foot

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Set up with stable supports. Tape ends to table so it won't slide

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Washers

**Description**: Finger trapping

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Encourage people not to stick their fingers in the washers lest they get stuck

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Splinters

**Description**: Wooden splinters from pole used to set it going, or support bar

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Demonstrator to visually inspect equipment before use. If the wood is not smooth, it should be sanded.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
