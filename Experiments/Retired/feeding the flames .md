## Risk Assessment

Risks 
1) burns 
2) fire becoming out of control 

Minimise risk 
1) take care when handling, plan talk so don't have to move things shortly after being extinguished 
2) Have specific places to burn things from where they will not spread 

In case of emergency 
1) run exposed area under cold water for 15 minutes, find first aider 
2) Know fire escapes and procedures for building, know location of nearest fire extinguishers and blankets 

whoosh bottle 
The bottle must be made of polycarbonate (look for the mark ‘PC’ on the base). Never use a glass bottle or a polycarbonate bottle that shows signs of damage, frosting or cracking.
• The bottle must be placed on a stable base. Only use a laboratory bench if the distance between the top of the bottle and the ceiling is greater than 2.5 m. The demonstration has been carried out successfully with the bottle standing on a laboratory stool. However, in this position, ensure that there is no risk of anyone leaning over the bottle when its contents are ignited.
• Check that there is nothing on the ceiling over the demonstration area that could be set alight.
• Never add pure oxygen to the bottle; use alcohol / air mixtures only.
• Wear eye protection. Use screen on audience side 
• After rolling the bottle, the vapour pressure inside may cause alcohol to spray out when the stopper is removed. Take care to avoid spraying yourself or the audience. Wipe off any alcohol that splashes on the outside of the bottle.
• Excess liquid alcohol must be removed from the bottle before the mixture is ignited. If left in the bottle, burning liquid may melt the plastic. If liquid does burn, restopper the bottle.
• Only use the ignition procedure suggested.
 • Make sure that a fire blanket and fire extinguisher are readily available.
