## Equipment Needed 
- Glass flask with lid for storing solution
- Clear plastic bottles
- 
- Reagents - These should be kept mixed in the flask if they will be used again soon however there are some spares if it needs replacing. It contains:
- 5g Sodium Hydroxide pellets
- 3g Dextrose (or probably Glucose)
- 250ml Distilled Water
- Indigo Carmine
- White paper to use as background for colour changes.
- 
- Could probably scale down all reagents to 50-100ml total volume.

## Experiment Explanation 

You should before beginning carefully pour the solution from the flask into a plastic screw top bottle (e.g. 500ml pepsi bottle) and tape the lid. Wear eye protection and gloves while decanting - sodium hydroxide causes skin and eye burns. Use as small a volume as needed to see the effect, 50-100ml may be sufficient. At the end of the day, cut the tape, pour the solution back into the flask. If possible replace the bottle the next day - do not use one bottle for several days. The solution seems to have limited effects on plastic over the course of a day but long term storage could have effects (we don't intend to find out) [source: Royal Society of Chemistry, they also do this experiment this way]. 

Consider having eye wash and paper towels nearby in case of spillage of solution.

Every so often while demonstrating you'll need to add a pinch of indigo carmine dye. You can show people the colour before it's added (unsurprisingly blue/indigo). Indigo Carmine is both a pH and redox indicator. Make sure dye is kept away from children as it is harmful if swallowed. 
Tech info has a range of 11.6-13 with blue acid and yellow alkali. 

Start by shaking the flask, the solution should go green after a good shake. Then observe, the solution goes from red to yellow. If you shake again it goes back to green!

What is happening? When we shake there must be some reaction happening, however the flask is sealed, so what is causing the reaction. When we shake we're mixing the air into the solution, we then react with the oxygen in the air. What's causing the colour change when we're not shaking then?

Starting from yellow we are in a fully reduced state, a small swirl introduce some oxygen and transitions to red. More oxygen takes us to Green, this is an oxidation.

From green the dye gets reduced by the dextrose, following the same backwards.

PLUS: From paper by Anderson et al, University of Winconsin-Madison. Under alkaline conditions, the glucose is ionised and tautomerises to the straight chain aldehyde and then to the key intermediate, an enediolate anion. This anion can reduce the dye, forming a keto-aldehyde, glycosulose, in the process. Shaking the flask introduces oxygen into the solution, which reoxidises the dye to the blue form, ready to repeat the process. The hydroperoxide anions this produces can cleave the keto-aldehyde in the presence of excess hydroxide to finally give the sodium salt of arabinonic acid.

There are several different colour changes if you shift pH a little bit, this should be placed for a nice traffic light. Lower pH gives a blue->purple->red->orange->yellow change but is slower due to less molarity (<11.4)
Higher pH gives yellow->red->yellow (>13). The one we have is in between, note green=blue+yellow. It's a bit of a pain in our set up our thing to change pH frequently and conserve resources.

You can also use different indicators, methylene blue in the same solution gives a classic 'blue bottle' reaction 

There are endo and exothermic directions with some noticeable heat or lack there of.

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Glass flask breaking

**Description**: Glass may end up on floor as a hazard to feet and crawling children. See below for risk of solution contact.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Transfer solution to a plastic bottle before demonstrating to mitigate risk of breaking. Keep glass container away during demonstration. If breakage occurs, clear area, solution can be safely cleared from floor with water or weak acid (vinegar) whilst wearing gloves. Sweep up any glass.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Spilled liquids

**Description**: Slip hazard if plastic bottle leaks and liquid gets on floor. See below for risk of solution contact.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Regularly change the plastic bottle to minimise impact of solution on plastic integrity and prevent leakage. Prevent children scrunching plastic and tape on lid. If leakage occurs, clear area, solution can be safely cleared from floor with water or weak acid (vinegar) whilst wearing gloves.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Human contact with solution

**Description**: Solution is basic and can cause skin and eye burns if it leaks from the container. It is also harmful if swallowed.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Call a first aider if available. If solution is spilt on skin, run area under running water, if in eyes use eye wash. If drank phone 999. Tape lid onto bottle to prevent kids getting in and change bottle regularly. Use smallest volume necessary to see effect.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10
