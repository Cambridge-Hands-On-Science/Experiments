## Equipment Needed 
- **Electricity needed**nan

<br/>

## Experiment Explanation 

- Ask audience to think about going on rollercoasters and what the best things about them are
- Can mention thrill, speed, loops the loops
- Brief history of rollercoasters and some interesting examples
- Rollercoaster videos?
- Talk about energy conservatioin: first rollercoaster go high, the higher they go the more speed they can pick up
- Loose energy when they go round due to friction (can ask people to rub their hands together to generate heat)
- Add some more fun to the rollercoasters by adding loops the loops
- Talk about why you don't fall out when you go upside down - not just because of the harness
- Show pre-pre-recorded video of demonstrating swinging a bucket of water round, and (hopefully!) not getting wet
- Think about safety of rollercoaster - talk about G force, dangers of it and astronauts
- Is there a best place to sit on a rollercoaster?
- Through the talk can use pre-pre-recorded video of some model rollercoaster tracks made from pip installation foam and shoot marbles down them

## Risk Assessment

### **Hazard**: Description/Videos of Rollercoasters

**Description**: Audience members becoming nauseous.

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Warn the audience at the start of the talk. Do not show any videos that are intentionally nauseating.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Friction demonstration

**Description**: Virtual Audience injuring their hands when rubbing them together over excitedly

**Affected People**: Public

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

**Mitigation**: Mention not to rub hands together for so long that they hurt.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Swinging bucket of water

**Description**: Someone could be hit by the bucket.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Make sure no one is standing near when the bucket is being swung and do not swing in the direction of anybody, and be careful not to hit oneself. Use a small plastic bucket as opposed to a large metal one. Do not fill with too much water as this makes the bucket heavy. Hold the bucket with a sturdy grip.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Water in bucket

**Description**: Slip hazard and electrical hazard when spilt

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Have towels and mop to hand unless doing outside on grass. A little bit of water is expected to be spilt. Do not use a huge amount of water - use about equiv. to a bottle of water. Before and after use, leave the bucket of water out of the way so it is unlikely to be knocked over. Do not demonstrate too close to people. Do not swing the bucket too close to electrical equipment.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Water in Bucket

**Description**: Wet demonstrator due to failure to swing the bucket fast enough

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Don't use that much water - about the equivalent of a bottle of water should be enough. Practice how fast it needs to be swung with small amounts of water first.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Model rollercoaster structure made from foam piping, cups and makeshift supports (e.g. books and boxes)

**Description**: Structure could collapse and cause blunt force injuries.

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Secure structure with tape. Make sure structure is secure before starting demonstration. Foam piping is light so even if that part of the structure collapses it shouldn't cause any injury.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Model rollercoaster structure made from foam piping, cups and makeshift supports (e.g. books and boxes)

**Description**: Trapped fingers/cuts from sharp edges

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Make sure there are no sharp edges.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4

<br/>

### **Hazard**: Marbles

**Description**: Slip hazard if dropped

**Affected People**: Demonstrator

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Pick up any dropped marbles immediately.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6
