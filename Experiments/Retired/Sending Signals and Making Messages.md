# Sending Signals and Making Messages

**Communications lecture used for CBS 2014 and 2015 and other past CBS years** - A fun talk about how humans have communicated over the years and how we can talk to each other privately in the modern world, with a few simple demonstrations of how the internet works and how to keep messages secret using encryption.

## Equipment Needed 
- String telephone (string, 2 plastic cups)
- 
- 4 boxes or trays, with colour coded names stuck to them
- Assorted colours of paper (blue, yellow, green, red) corresponding to box colours
- Paper planes (white, blue, yellow, red, green), with enough of the right colours to form the 5x5 image used in the presentation and numbered as in the diagram, and some extra planes of various colours
- 
- Plastic toolbox
- 2 locks/padlocks for toolbox
- Torch
- 
- Laser pointer (useful, not necessary)
- 2 demonstrators (possible with one but not as good)
- 3rd demonstrator as plant in audience (optional)

## Experiment Explanation 

Summary of Talk
---------------


 See attached documents for full content and experiment demonstrations

Slide 1 - Cover slide

Slide 2 - Introduction

Slide 3 - Frame problems and goals of communicating, such as fast, reliable delivery over long distances, in a secure manner. The 3rd demonstrator in the audience should be used at this time to demonstrate security problems by stealing a message.

Slide 4 - Historical Perspectives on Communication - Examples of methods used in the past

Slide 5 - Historical Perspectives on Communication 2 - Morse code as an example of sending arbitrary messges quickly, with the Titanic shown as the first occurence of an SOS message sent by Morse code

Slide 6 - Example of Caesar cipher as a simple way to encrypt message and ensure safety, point out such simple methods are quick to brute force solve.

Slide 7 - Demonstration of assymetric key encryption as a way of sending a secure message, using a box and 2 locks, with the front row of the audience as the transmission medium

Slide 8 - The Telephone as a Method of Communication - Demonstrate with string telephone, possibly with audience volunteer

Slide 9 - Problems of One-to-One Communication Lines - Shows the arithmetic progression of lines required

Slide 10 - Problems of One-to-One Communication Lines 2 - Poses question to audience of how many lines 100 connections needs

Slide 11 - Problems of One-to-One Communication Lines 3 - Presents answer, and shows arithmetic sum formula as a quick method of calculation

Slide 12 - Communications Networks - Shows how connections are arranged to allow full connectivity via other nodes

Slide 13 - Demonstration of Sending Messages via Network - Uses colour-coded boxes and paper aeroplanes to demonstrate connectionless switching, using the audience as an analogy to the network

Slide 14 - Demonstration of Packets in Networks to Send Large Messages - Uses colour-coded boxes and paper aeroplanes to demonstrate packet switching networks sending images, using the audience as an analogy to the network

Slide 15 - Interim slide, displayed while previous demonstration is occuring, as a prompt for the audience

Slide 16 - Recap of initial image to assist in reassembly of image, with volunteer help

Slide 17 - Concluding slide, summing up talk and thanking audience, showing CHaOS contact details

## Risk Assessment

('RISKS', 'Trip hazard of string')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS', 'Ensure string telephone is kept in storage box when not in use, with string neatly coiled inside a cup. When in use, ensure no audience members are near, unless using it.')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT', 'Call First Aider')

<br/>

()

<br/>

('DESCRIPTION', 'A box is locked with a lock, passed to a second demonstrator via the audience, locked again, then returned. The original lock is removed, then passed back, allowing the second lock to be removed, passig a message securely with no exchange of keys.')

<br/>

('RISKS', 'Audience may drop box  Keys and locks are small and are swallowing hazard')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS', 'Boxes are selected so they are light plastic, with no sharp edges  Keys and locks are strictly kept in the possession of demonstrators, except when securely attached to the box')

<br/>

('ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT', 'Call a first aider.')
