## Talk Outline

**Introduction:** What are we made of?

- Our bodies are like houses - inside each house are tiny rooms called cells.
- Houses have blueprints and in our cells the blueprint is something called DNA.
- All cells have the same set of DNA.

Why are cells different from each other?

- DNA is the same in all cells but the set of instructions being used changes.
- If all these rooms are cake factories, then the DNA would be the cookbook - different recipes used in each factory.
- Cell differentiation

¬¬- DNA – cookbook of the cell

- Recipe is written in a language with four letters (A, T, C, G)– comes in pairs
- Written down on the double helix – a self copying cookbook!
  ¬¬¬- Ribosomes: the bakers in this factory
- Free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.
- Make all the proteins in the cell.

How is this cookbook used?

- Transcription - writing down the recipe

  - RNA polymerases unwind the double helix so they can read the recipe
  - Make a complementary RNA strand

  - DNA has labels (histone modifications, transcription factors) telling you which cakes to bake more/less of
  - Get a volunteer to go to the labelled page of the cookbook and write down the instructions

- Translation - baking the cake!
  - The bakers (ribosomes) in our cells can't read the language that the book is written in!
  - Reading is done by tRNAs – act as translators - each ingredient is only brought in if the shape of the tRNA matches that of the mRNA codon.
- (demonstrate this on the slide), then volunteers take the instructions for a committee member (?) to string together the ingredients (beads representing amino acids – Tom’s protein folding demo?)
- Ingredients go through “baking” – folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and get decorated – post translational modifications, then they are ready to do their job!

- But cells are not big and roomy like factories
- Squeezed in – very crowded
- Have wool and balls representing DNA and organelles and shake it around a big cardboard box – it should all come out tangled
- The cell cannot work like this – it needs to tidy things up!
  Challenges in the Cell:
- Cells are very small but lots of stuff inside – 2m of DNA in a nucleus 10 um wide – If a cell were the size of a tennis ball then the DNA would be 40 km long!
- Demonstration – If we just put all this stuff inside a cell (Cardboard box) and shake them up – will all get tangled!
- How do we read the recipe when it’s this crowded?

- Cell Organization
  - Eukaryotes (like you and me, and all other animals and plants and mushrooms…)
- Have membranes inside the cell – organelles

- Nucleus – like a secret vault keeping the recipe safe from any damage
- the recipe is wrapped up like scrolls – chromatin
- keeps it from getting tangled up
- how tight the scrolls are bound and how they are stacked up on each other determines how much of each protein is made
- Membrane pores – like gates – control which transcripts get out of the nucleus

- Endoplasmic reticulum – studded with the ribosome bakers
- where more complicated proteins are made and properly folded
- Post translational modifications

- Prokaryotes – single cells too small to see
- No membranes – but still well organised
- Supercoiling – lots of proteins make DNA in bacteria loop around
- Very different systems, so we can make use of this to make antibiotics and kill germs

- Conclusion

## Risk assessment

<br/>

### Demo: Fitting DNA into the cell

#### **Hazard**: Tripping on props e.g. wool

**Description**: Tripping over props or cables can cause injuries
**Affected People**: Volunteers, Children, Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Do not take out props until needed and tidy away straight after.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
