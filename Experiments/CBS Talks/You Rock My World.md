## Equipment Needed

- Collection of copper coins (from Cleaning Coppers)
- Ribbon marked with geological time scale
- Blu-tack to stick up ribbon
- Petrographic microscope with HDMI camera (borrowed from Earth Sciences)
- Selection of rocks and thin sections
- Projector and visualiser

## Talk Outline

**Introduction:** rocks are Earth’s oldest time capsules.

- They are billions of years old!
- They can record what was happening on Earth (Uniformitarianism: by seeing how rocks are created today, we know what processes have created similar rocks in the past)
  - Example of rippled sandstone?

What is a **rock**?

- Usually made of minerals (e.g. quartz; calcite)
- These can take the form of interlocking crystals, sand, mud, shells, etc.
- Some contain fossils: preserved bits of (or traces left by) living things
  - Life is the biggest thing that has changed over Earth’s history

Oldest rocks are **meteorites** (older than Earth!)

- Can tell us how Solar System and planets form
- I might be able to borrow some from the Sedgwick if I ask nicely! Otherwise we have the iron meteorite in Rocks and Fossils
- _Demo_: Volunteer helps to pull out a coloured ribbon to compare age of earth with age of Homo Sapiens
  - Ribbon also has the other events marked? Wind up through talk to see how far we’ve come?

Oldest rock from Earth is (debatably) **Acasta Gneiss** (4 Ga).

- Looks similar to Lewisian Gneiss (oldest rock in UK; 3 Ga) – show under microscope, explain how crystals have grown due to heat and pressure: a metamorphic rock
- Earliest signs of life – stromatolites, bits of organic carbon (made from photosynthesis?)

More convincing fossils in **Gunflint Chert** (2 Ga).

- Persuade Butterfield to let me borrow a slide?
- Life is still single celled, but by now has oxygenated the atmosphere

How do we know **how old** these things are, anyway?

- Find a zircon in biotite – show radiation halo
- These crystals contain uranium – ask audience if they know what uranium does.
- It decays into lead, and the longer you wait the more Pb you get and the less U is left
- _Demo of radioactive decay_:
  - Give everyone (that is responsible enough not to eat it) a coin from Cleaning Coppers. Use a clicker to count the number of coins given out (in zircon we would know this amount from mineral chemistry)
  - Those who do not have a coin represent initial amount of lead in zircon – this is a known quantity from mineral chemistry.
  - Everyone who has a coin stands up – they are uranium atoms.
  - Send an assistant out of the room so they do not know how many cycles we are going to do.
  - Pretend we have waited one half-life. Everyone flips their coin (parents can flip children’s coins for them). If they get heads, they have decayed into lead and sit down.
  - Repeat this 2-4 times.
  - The assistant comes back in, and counts the number of people still standing.
  - Have an Excel formula ready to go – we put in the initial number of coins and the number of people still standing and it should let the assistant predict how many half-lives have gone.

Back to rocks, and the story of life.

**Ediacaran biota** (600 Ma) are the first fossils of multicellular animals

- Discovered by schoolchildren in Charnwood Forest!
- See if I can get hold of a cast.
- Live in the rippled sandstone we saw – imagine ancient beaches.

Then the **Cambrian explosion** (500 Ma) – all the modern groups of animals suddenly appear (+ some v weird ones that are now extinct)

- See if I can get some Burgess Shale from Butterfield.
- Muddy deep sea!

Talk about interpretation of **Carboniferous cyclothems** (310 Ma) (if time)

- Ice ages → low sea level → swamps with plants decaying to form coal
- Ice melts → higher sea level → beaches and deltas

Chalk seas of **Cretaceous** (100 Ma).

- Sea level rise meant that much of continents are covered in shallow layer of water
- Plankton create tiny shells that form the rock (show SEM image)
- Fossils: ammonites, sea urchins, marine reptiles

**K-T extinction** (66 Ma):

- Layer of iridium and tektites suggests a meteorite impact
- Disappearance of ammonites and dinosaurs from fossil record.
- Explosion in mammal diversity afterwards

Back to **Homo sapiens** (300 ka)

- Fossils appear in Morocco
- Meanwhile, in the UK, boulder clay is being deposited – what could transport giant boulders?
- We also get U-shaped valleys and rock surfaces with ‘scratches’ on them from ice
  - Similar to what was seen in polar rocks of Carboniferous
- From weight of oxygen in tiny sea shells (foraminifera) we know that there has actually been about 30 ice ages in the last 2.5 Ma!

**Present day:** we are currently living in interglacial. If cycle continues then there will be another ice age in 100 ka or so

- But we might have broken it with CO₂ emissions (show hockey stick)
- Life has been influencing Earth’s geochemistry for billions of years (GOE, shells) but we are doing it faster than ever before!
- The ‘Anthropocene’ will certainly be an interesting age for future geologists to study!

## Risk Assessment

### Ribbon Demo

#### **Hazard**: Volunteer moving around lecture theatre with ribbon

**Description**: Slips/trips/falls, especially if they are running or not looking where they're going.

**Affected People**: Volunteer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Check area at front of lecture theatre is clear of trip hazards/general mess before the demo starts. Choose a volunteer who seems responsible. Tell them to walk carefully (not run or go up steps) before giving them the ribbon to pull.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

#### **Hazard**: Ribbon

**Description**: Trip hazard after it has been unrolled

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Attach ribbon to wall at both ends after unrolling. Check that it is still attached before moving around / inviting any volunteers.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### Radioactive Decay Demo

#### **Hazard**: Coins

**Description**: Choking hazard if put in mouth

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: When giving out coins at the beginning, do not give to very young children who cannot be trusted to not eat them. Even for older children, give their coins to a responsible adult to look after them until the demo happens, and tell the adult to keep an eye on the coin at all times and to take it back after the demo. In case of choking, call a first aider immediately (they should already be on site).

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

#### **Hazard**: Coins

**Description**: Coins may be dirty and possibly carry diseases.

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Wash coins before starting. Tell people to wash their hands after touching the coins and before eating.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Flipping coins

**Description**: If people lose control of coins when flipping them, they might hit other audience members, or they may hurt themselves trying to pick the coins up again.

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Responsible adults can flip coins for their young children. Tell everyone to flip their coins by clasping them in two hands and gently shaking rather than launching the coin into the air.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

<br/>

### Demo: Showing Rocks and Slides

#### **Hazard**: Rocks and Microscope Slides

**Description**: Rocks may be heavy and may break to produce dust / sharp edges (especially for fragile microscope slides) if dropped.

**Affected People**: Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: No rocks used should be overly heavy. Lecturer should handle rocks and slides with care and keep over desk so they cannot fall on floor. If breakages do occur, wrap in paper towel and put in bag in safe location.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Rocks

**Description**: Rocks may contain toxic compounds or contamination from previous handlers and cause illness if ingested.

**Affected People**: Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: No rocks used should contain overly toxic minerals. Lecturer (and anyone else who has handled the rocks) should wash their hands after touching the rocks and before eating.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
