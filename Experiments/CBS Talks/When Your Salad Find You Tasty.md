## Talk outline


The aim is to try and involve the audience in moving the talk forward throughout, treat the talk as a ‘call and response’ exercise. Each section will begin with a question and the content will be framed as answer to the question. 

Begin and ask audience about their ideas about plants, ask about examples, known properties. 

Ask audience about what they know about requirements for plants to grow (light, water, nutrients etc) 

Change the subject to specialised plants (cacti for retaining water, etc) then introduce carnivory as a specialisation. 

Talk about the variety of ways plants can trap animals (With practical demonstrations) 

Talk about how these traits can arise from ‘normal plants’
