## Experiment Explanation

### Indicator reactions
Phenopthalein
Beaker 1: dilute solution of NaOH
Beaker 2: washed with phenopthalein solution
Beaker 3: washed with HCl solution
1. Pour beaker 1 into beaker 2. It should turn pink. 
2. Pour beaker 2 into beaker 3. It should turn clear again. 

Indigo carmine (chemical traffic lights)
Beaker 1: 20ml of water
Beaker 2: 70ml of 0.4M NaOH (ideally warmed)
Beaker 3: 2.5g of dextrose in 10ml water
Bottle with lid: 0.02g indigo carmine
1. Add water to bottle and shake to dissolve (turns blue).
2. Add NaOH (turns green). 
3. Add glucose (different shade of green - if yellow, add a few more crystals of dye). 
4. Replace lid and wait (green -> red -> yellow). 
5. Shake gently (yellow -> red).
6. Shake more vigourously (red -> green).

Methylene blue
To be prepared <20 mins beforehand:
1. Make solution of 0.05g methylene blue in 50ml ethanol
2. Combine 8g KOH, 300ml water and 10g glucose in bottle with lid and dissolve
3. Add 5ml methylene blue solution. Should turn colourless in under one minute. 
In the presentation:
4. Shake the bottle vigorously. Should turn blue then fade back to colourless.

### Flame tests
Burn methanol-salt mixes to show different colours. 
Soak £50 in 1:1 mix of methanol and water. Burn over flame. The alcohol will burn away but the note should be protected by the water. 

### Elephant's toothpaste
1. Add half a cup of hydrogen peroxide to the cylinder
2. Add large squirt of dish soap and swirl to mix
3. Add a few drops of food colouring
4. Mix one tablespoon yeast and three tablespoons of warm water in a measuring cup. Stir for 30 seconds. 
5. Pour yeast into cylinder. 

### Hydrogen and helium
1. Tape candle to the end of the stick and light. 
2. Hold candle next to hydrogen and helium balloons. They should pop.
