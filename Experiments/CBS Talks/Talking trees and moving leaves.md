## Talk Outline

**Introduction:** What do you notice the most?

- Show pictures of plants with animals in and ask what they see first
- Plants often go a bit unnoticed
- Time to change that!
- If you turned into a plant, what would you miss the most?
- Plants can't get up and move around like we can, and because of that they have to do things very differently.

**How do plants eat?**

- Plants make their own food from water and carbon dioxide, with the power of the sun!
- **Experiment** Spinach producing oxygen!
- They store the sugar they make, and we eat it!

**How do plants find the things they need to make food?**

- 1. Carbon dioxide --> they have little holes in their leaves so that air can pass in and out
- 2. Sunlight --> **Video** of plants turning towards the light, **Demonstration** of auxin making dark side of plants grow causing bending
- 3. Water --> Roots can sense water gradients, but inerestingly they can also **hear** water flowing

**So, plants can make their own food, they can detect light and they can even hear!**

**Plants often have the problem that animals think of them as food - how do they protect themselves from being eaten?**

- First, plants need to know they're being eaten
- If there was a little caterpillar on your arm, nibbling away you, how would you know?
- **Video** plant signalling with calcium
- Plants let others knows they're in danger by sending off chemical signals, basically really complicated smells
- Example 1: Alder trees and the Alder leaf beetle larvae
- Example 2: Tobacco plants, hornworm caterpillars and big-eyed bugs

**Some plants take it a step further and become predators!**

- Venus fly traps snap up flies and digest them
- We've gone over how plants can feel, but how does the venus fly trap know that it's actually a fly and not a bit of mud?
- They can count!
- **Venus fly trap demonstration**

**Summary of what we've covered**

**End with a plant that scientists still don't understand**

- Just like how chameleons chang their skin colour, this vine changes its leaf shape

**Conclusion**

Plants can
- Make their own food!
- Detect light!
- Hear water!
- Feel bugs on them!
- Smell complicated chemicals
- Talk to each other and other organisms using these chemicals
- Count!
- AND even diguise themselves

I hope next time you're walking through a forest looking at birds or squirrels you give a passing nod to all the plants you see!

## Risk Assessment

### Spinach photosynthesis demo

#### **Hazard**: Volunteer moving around at or towards the front of lecture theatre

**Description**: Slips/trips/falls, especially if they are running or not looking where they're going.

**Affected People**: Volunteer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Check area at front of lecture theatre is clear of trip hazards/general mess before the demo starts. Tell them to walk carefully to and from the front of the leature theatre.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Water spillage from beaker

**Description**: Slip hazard

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ensure that only the lecturer moves the beaker around (if at all) and that it is filled before the lecture

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Glass beaker breaking

**Description**: Sharp hazard

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Ensure beaker is placed in a sturdy location and do not let volunteers touch it. Swap out for a plastic beaker if possible.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 1, Overall: 1

#### **Hazard**: Bright torchlight

**Description**: Eye injury if shone in eyes

**Affected People**: Volunteer, Lecturer, People near front of theatre

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Direct the voluteer to only shine the torch at the spinach.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Cutting of spinach with hole punch

**Description**: Injury to hands if mishandlesd

**Affected People**: Volunteer, Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Lecturer to do this just before the lecture

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

<br/>

### Auxin balloon demo

#### **Hazard**: Balloon popping

**Description**: Loud noises

**Affected People**: Lecturer, audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 3

**Mitigation**: Ensure that the balloons are very deflated beforehand, and keep a close eye on how close to full they are.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

#### **Hazard**: Latex

**Description**: Latex allergy

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 5, Overall: 10

**Mitigation**: Ensure that anyone touching the balloons does not have a latex allergy. Limit experiment only to lecturer to guarantee this.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

<br/>

### Venus fly trap

#### **Hazard**: Fly trap snapping shut

**Description**: Trap could snap shut on fingers, injuring them

**Affected People**: Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Only use a long paintbrush to trigger the fly trap, so fingers are not near the plant.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3
