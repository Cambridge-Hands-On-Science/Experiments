## Experiment Explanation

The history of malaria, how mosquitoes spread it, and how we eradicated the disease

The risk assessment is for bringing in live mosquitoes to demonstrate the malaria vector and what I use in the lab.

The mosquitoes are **uninfected** by any malarias and non-native to the UK (not able to survive cold weather).

The mosquitoes are kept in a cage in the lab. I will take that cage and place it into a plastic box to transport the mosquitoes. They will also stay in the box at all times except when I take the cage out of the box for approximately 10 minutes for the demonstration after which I will replace the cage into the box.

I will be the only person to handle the box and the cage.

At no time will the mosquitoes be able to leave the cage.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Live Anopheles Stephensi mosquitoes 

**Description**: The mosquitoes could escape and bite someone (either children, their parents, or other members of the public), or establish a colony in the wild

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**:  The mosquitoes will only be handled by the demonstrator and their cage will be kept in another container outside of the 5 minutes or so of the demonstration. Use electric insect swatter so the demonstrator can quickly kill it. Ointment should also be brought to the session in case of bites.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 2, Overall: 4
