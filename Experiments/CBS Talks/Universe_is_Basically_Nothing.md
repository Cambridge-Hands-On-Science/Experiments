## Equipment Needed

- Projector and visualiser
- Slides
- Model of atoms (Ping pong balls on a board)
- Nerf gun w/ foam bullets
- Silk and glass rod
- van de Graaf generator
- Cake tins

## Experiment Explanation

Demo 1: Demonstration of Rutherford’s gold foil experiment. Part 1 is to demonstrate the John Dalton model. A member of the audience (above 12 years old and relatively responsible) will be given a nurf gun with darts acting as alpha particles. They will have a paper figure to shoot at initially to practice their aim. They will then shoot at a model of atoms in gold foil (ping pong balls stuck to a backboard) to observe how the alpha particles just bounce back.

Part 2 involves shooting at a net instead to see how most of the alpha particles pass straight through with only some being deflected/bouncing back. 

Demo 2: The second demonstration is to explain how positive charges repel each other, and so how it is anti-intuitive for the nucleus to be an accumulation of positive charge. A brief explanation of the strong force will follow. A glass rod will be rubbed with silk, for a positive charge to accumulate. A balloon will also be rubbed to accumulate a positive charge. The rod and balloon will be brought close to each other to show how they repel one another.

Demo 3: The second demonstration is to explain how negative charges repel each other using a Van de Graaff generator. This will lead into the understanding of electrons being in ‘shells’ where they are spaced far apart from each other.

This experiment consists of 2 parts. Part 1 involves a volunteer touching the Van de Graaff generator and their hairs standing on end.

Part 2 involves placing foil cake cases onto the Van de Graaff and showing how the cases repel each other as they all fly off.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Hazard section: Copy and paste this for as many hazards that there are -->

### **Hazard**: Nerf gun

**Description**: Volunteer could accidentally or on purpose shoot someone

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**:  Ensure the volunteer is a teenager or adult. Make volunteer practice using gun by shooting at target on wall. Make sure shooting is not in direction of audience. Ensure foam bullets are soft. If someone is shot and badly harmed, call a first aider. 

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

### **Hazard**: Net and blackboard

**Description**: Nerf bullets bouncing back from board and hitting someone

**Affected People**: Bystanders

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: All participants involved made to wear goggles. Audience made to not sit in front few rows.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

### **Hazard**: Glass rod

**Description**: Being dropped, producing sharp pieces that can cause cuts

**Affected People**: Bystanders

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Nobody from the audience will be holding the glass rod. Glass rod checked for cracks before use. If glass rod does break, dispose of it carefully. In the event of an accident, call a first aider.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

### **Hazard**: Balloon

**Description**: Popping and hurting people’s ears; or popping in someone’s hands

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 2, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Ensure balloon is not overinflated

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 2, Overall: 2

### **Hazard**: van de Graaf generator

**Description**: Giving somebody an electric shock

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Have a grounded discharge electrode that can be used to discharge the VDG before the generator is touched or turned on/off. When an individual is being discharged for the hair-raising demo, discharge them in a controlled manner by making them hold wooden stick until hair falls (+30 seconds longer). Ensure nobody with a heart condition performs the hair raising-experiment. Call first aider in event of accident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

### **Hazard**: Cake tins

**Description**: Flying into someone and hurting them

**Affected People**: All

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 2, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Ensure first few rows of audience are not occupied. Call first aider in event of accident.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 1, Overall: 2
