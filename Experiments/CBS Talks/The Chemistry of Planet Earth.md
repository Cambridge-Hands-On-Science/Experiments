## Talk Outline

All solutions to be prepared in advance of the lecture using the control measures detailed in the risk assessment.

### Introduction

- The most complex chemistry lab on Earth is ... Earth!
- Important to understand the chemistry that goes on as it affects all of us.

### What is Earth made of?

- Layers of Earth: Model?
- First we have to look at the Sun

#### Demonstration: Solar Spectra

- Blow torch set up in clamp stand with safety screens and heatproof mats to protect surface if necessary.
- Lecturer to wear safety specs and heat proof gloves
- Spray mixture of ethanol and salt solution into the flame (downwards, away from audience) using a spray bottle to produce coloured fire
- Repeat for Cu, Na, Li?
- In a practice run, we will have taken pictures of the fire through a diffraction grating to show the spectral lines: show on Powerpoint

- So each element has characteristic colours that they can emit and absorb
- Show real solar spectra and elements.
- Then show elemental composition of Earth. What is different and why?
- Talk about formation of core and crust
- Meteorites?
- Show mantle rock

### Volcanoes

- Show volcanic and mantle rock: how do we get from this to this?
- Start by melting the mantle: explain tectonic settings
- Explain sources of gas
- Explain how magma migrates to volcanoes

#### Demonstration: Volcanic Eruptions

- Gas dissolved in magma similar to CO2 dissolved in bottle of Coke.
- Place Coke in tray, with paper model of stratovolcano over it
- Get a volunteer, give them lab coat and safety specs
- Simulate magma rising to surface by taking the top off
- Add mentos (while holding another tray over it) to create nucleation points (representing crystals)
- Describe similarity to explosive eruptions
- Talk about other types of volcano, why OIBs not explosive but subduction zone volcanoes are.

### Carbon in the Ocean

- Where does the CO2 emitted from volcanoes end up? Dissolved in ocean!
- Certain creatures have found a use for this carbon, to make shells (show shells / fossils).
- Do this by precipitating a mineral - calcium carbonate, by using biological pumps to mix the carbon with calcium from the seawater

#### Demonstration: Calcium carbonate precipitation

- Find a sensible looking volunteer, give them lab coat and safety specs
- Get them to pour 500ml 0.5M calcium chloride solution into a 1L bottle
- Get them to pour 500ml 0.4M sodium bicarbonate solution into the bottle
- They should react to form solid calcium carbonate
- What is happening to CO2 in the atmosphere at the moment? Going up, but some dissolving in ocean

#### Demonstration: Ocean acidification

- Demonstrate ocean acidification by adding a few small pieces of dry ice into a 2L bottle containing water with a few drops of sodium hydroxide and universal indicator solution.
- Repeat precipitation experiment in another bottle containing a little bit of vinegar.
- Dissolve the calcium carbonate that has already been precipitated

<br/>

- Explain implications of ocean acidification for the carbon cycle.
- This is why understanding geochemistry is important!
