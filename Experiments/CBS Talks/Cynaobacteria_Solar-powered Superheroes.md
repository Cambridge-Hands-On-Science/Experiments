## Equipment Needed

- Stromatolite sections (from Jenny Zhang)
- Stoppered flask of chlorophyll extracted from spinach (done beforehand)
- Bag of spinach
- UV torch
- Velcroed together 'atoms' and 'electrons' made from tennis balls
- Two green hats (made from paper)
- Buckets/bowls (appropriately labelled/colour-coded)
- Normal/red light torch
- Selection of plants
- Tubes of cyanobacteria

<br/>

## Talk Outline

**Introduction:** How do plants eat?

- Show the plants
- They make their own food from sunlight! (Photosynthesis)
- They take water and carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen (for us to breathe!) and sugars (for them to eat!)
- Plants have existed for the last 850 million years (ish) but things have been making their own food just like plants do for nearly 2.7 BILLION years!

These are little creatures called **cyanobacteria**

- They were the first creatures on earth to photosynthesise
- Made too much oxygen and killed everything else (the great oxidation event)
- Fossil evidence in the form of **stromatolites** that are still around today! (in Australia mostly)

**Stromatolites and Cyanobacteria test tubes to be passed around audience**

- Show what stromatolite fossils look like
- Show what cyanobacteria look like when they're just living in liquid solution
- They're still green! Things that photosynthesise are often green

**Why are plants and cyanobacteria green?**

- They contain special molecules that harvest light
- Explanation of how molecules absorb light - electrons! (What is an electron?)
- Chlorphyll absorbs everything apart from green so we see green
- **Chlorophyll fluorescence demonstration** using chlorophyll extracted from spinach and a UV torch

**How does the chlorophyll help?**

- They use the light absorbed to turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugar using lots of tiny machines inside the cells
- This is called the photosynthetic electron transport chain

**PETC explanation and demo**

- Three volunteers as the three main complexes in the PETC (PSII, Cytb6f, PSI)
- One volunteer as ATP synthase
- Photosystem I and II wear green hats to signify they have chlorophyll in
- 'Molecules' made of balls and velcro in buckets
- PSII person has torch shone at them, picks up 'water' from bucket and tears it into 'oxygen', 'hydrogen' and 'electron'
- 'Hydrogen' goes into bowl at Cytb6f's feet, 'oxygen' goes into 'oxygen' bucket, excited 'electron' gets passed to Cytb6f
- Cytb6f uses energy from 'electron' to move 'hydrogen' from bucket on desk into bucket at their feet, passes 'electron' to PSI
- When PSI has light shone at them, they put the excited 'electron' into a special bucket full of sweets
- ATP synthase grabs the 'hydrogen' bucket and spins around.
- Now we can take a sweet because we've made sugar!

Electrons are really important to make food in plants! What else uses electrons? - **Electricity**

- Could we use the electrons in cyanobacteria or plants to make electricity?
- If we shine light on them, they make lots of excited electrons
- We can actually use these!

**Batteries made from algae!**

- Researchers have made batteries from cyanobacteria that can power a little computer for two years!
- The bacteria can keep growing and living inside the battery and we just need sunlight to get electricity!

**Conclusion**

- Learned about how plants make food
- Cyanobacteria do the same thing! And they're really old but still around today
- They have really complicated little machines inside that absorb light and turn it into electrons
- We can use these electrons to power things with electricity!
- So next time you see a leaf on a tree, think about how complicated it is inside, and say thanks for making the oxygen we need to breathe!

## Risk Assessment

### Photosynthetic ETC demo

#### **Hazard**: Volunteers moving around at or towards the front of lecture theatre

**Description**: Slips/trips/falls, especially if they are running or not looking where they're going.

**Affected People**: Volunteer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Check area at front of lecture theatre is clear of trip hazards/general mess before the demo starts. Choose volunteers who seems responsible. Tell them to walk carefully to and from the front of the leature theatre.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

#### **Hazard**: Balls representing electrons and atoms

**Description**: Trip hazard

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 4, Severity: 3, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Buckets to move balls from/to rather to avoid them being on the floor.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

#### **Hazard**: Balls representing electrons and atoms

**Description**: Risk of injury if balls are thrown

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Choose volunteers who seem sensible, explicitly tell them not to throw the balls.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

#### **Hazard**: Visible torch

**Description**: Eye injury if shone in eyes

**Affected People**: Volunteers

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 3, Overall: 9

**Mitigation**: Lecturer to ensure that torch is aimed away from eyes and only turned on for short periods of time.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

<br/>

### Chlorophyll fluoresecence demo

#### **Hazard**: Chlorophyll/Methanol solution

**Description**: Toxicity of methanol if vapour is inhaled or if drunk

**Affected People**: Lecturer

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 5, Overall: 15

**Mitigation**: Keep methanol/chlorophyll micture in a sealed flask and check thoroughly for leaks beforehand. Seal should be a stopper held firmly in place with parafilm and should not be opened during the lecture.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 5, Overall: 5

#### **Hazard**: UV Torch

**Description**: Damage to eyes/skin from exposure to UV

**Affected People**: Lecturer, Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 3, Severity: 4, Overall: 12

**Mitigation**: Use UV torch that is near-visible, direct away from audience members and lecturer. Turn off immediately after use.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 4, Overall: 4

<br/>

### Showing stromatolites and cyanobacteria

#### **Hazard**: Stromatolites

**Description**: Stromatolites may be dropped when passed around, causing injury

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 3, Overall: 6

**Mitigation**: Do not use stromatolites that are overly heavy. Tell audience to take care when passing.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Cyanobacteria

**Description**: Spillage of cyanobacteria from their test tubes

**Affected People**: Audience

**Before Mitigation**: Likelihood: 2, Severity: 4, Overall: 8

**Mitigation**: Plastic test tubes used to avoid risk of breaking glass. Test tubes should be sealed with parafilm and tape so they cannot be opened. Tell audience not to open them. If spillage does occur then wash hands immediately.

**After Mitigation**: Likelihood: 1, Severity: 3, Overall: 3

#### **Hazard**: Stromatolites and Cyanobacteria

**Description**: Objects may be dirty, bacteria could cause illness
